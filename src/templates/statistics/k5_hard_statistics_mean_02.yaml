template: |
  {{name}} wants an average of {{target_mean}} on 5 tests.
  So far, {{name}} has scored {{score1}}, {{score2}}, {{score3}}, and {{score4}} on the first 4 tests.
  
  What score does {{name}} need on the 5th test to reach the target average?

solution: |
  # Calculate needed total for target mean
  needed_total = target_mean * 5
  
  # Calculate current sum
  current_sum = score1 + score2 + score3 + score4
  
  # Find needed score
  Answer = needed_total - current_sum

      answer: "84"
  
  - seed: 67890
    expected:
      answer: "92"
