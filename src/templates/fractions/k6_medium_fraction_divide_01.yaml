  How many pieces of rope {{a}}/{{b}} meter long can be cut from a rope that is {{c}}/{{d}} meters long?

solution: |
  from math import gcd
  
  # Division: (c/d) ÷ (a/b) = (c*b)/(d*a)
  numerator = c * b
  denominator = d * a
  
  # This should result in a whole number
  common = gcd(numerator, denominator)
  simplified_num = numerator // common
  simplified_den = denominator // common
  
  # Convert to integer answer
  Answer = simplified_num // simplified_den
