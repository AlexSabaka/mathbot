template: |
  {{name}} walked {{a}}/{{b}} of a mile in the morning and {{c}}/{{d}} of a mile in the afternoon. How far did {{name}} walk in total?

solution: |
  from math import gcd
  
  # Find LCD manually
  def lcm(a, b):
    return abs(a * b) // gcd(a, b)
  
  lcd = lcm(b, d)
  
  # Convert to common denominator
  new_a = a * (lcd // b)
  new_c = c * (lcd // d)
  
  # Add numerators
  numerator = new_a + new_c
  denominator = lcd
  
  # Simplify
  common = gcd(numerator, denominator)
  Answer = (numerator // common, denominator // common)
