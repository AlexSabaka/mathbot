template: |
  A school has {{total_students}} students going on a field trip. Each bus holds {{bus_capacity}} students. How many buses are needed, and how many empty seats will there be on the last bus?

solution: |
  # Calculate buses needed
  full_buses = total_students // bus_capacity
  students_in_last = total_students % bus_capacity
  
  # If there's a remainder, we need one more bus
  if students_in_last > 0:
    total_buses = full_buses + 1
    empty_seats = bus_capacity - students_in_last
    Answer = f"{total_buses} buses needed | {empty_seats} empty seats"
  else:
    # All buses are full
    Answer = f"{full_buses} buses needed | 0 empty seats"
