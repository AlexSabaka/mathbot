template: |
  {{name}} walks from point ({{x1}}, {{y1}}) to point ({{x2}}, {{y2}}) on a coordinate grid where each unit represents 1 block.
  
  If {{name}} walks only horizontally and then vertically, what is the horizontal distance and vertical distance traveled?

solution: |
  # Calculate distances
  horizontal_distance = abs(x2 - x1)
  vertical_distance = abs(y2 - y1)
  
  Answer1 = horizontal_distance
  Answer2 = vertical_distance
