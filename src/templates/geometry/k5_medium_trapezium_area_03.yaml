template: |
  A trapezoid has an area of {{area}} square meters, a height of {{height}} meters, and one parallel side of {{base1}} meters.
  What is the length of the other parallel side?

solution: |
  # Area = ((base1 + base2) × height) / 2
  # base2 = (2 × area / height) - base1
  base2 = (2 * area // height) - base1
  Answer = base2
