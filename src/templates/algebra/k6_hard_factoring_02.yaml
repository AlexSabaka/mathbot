variables:
  var:
    type: string
    choices: [x, y, n]
  a:
    type: integer
    min: 6
    max: 24
  b:
    type: integer
    min: 4
    max: 18
  Answer:
    type: string

template: |
  Factor: {{a}}{{var}}^2 - {{b}}{{var}}

solution: |
  # Find GCF of a and b
  import math
  gcf = math.gcd(a, b)
  coeff1 = a // gcf
  coeff2 = b // gcf
  
  # Factor: gcf*var(coeff1*var - coeff2)
  if gcf == 1:
      Answer = f"{var}({a}{var} - {b})"
  else:
      Answer = f"{gcf}{var}({coeff1}{var} - {coeff2})"
