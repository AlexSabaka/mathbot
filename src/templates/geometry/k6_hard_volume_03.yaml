template: |
  {{name}} has a water tank measuring {{tank_length}} cm by {{tank_width}} cm by {{tank_height}} cm. The tank is {{fill_num}}/{{fill_den}} full of water.
  
  What is the volume of water in the tank?

solution: |
  # Total volume
  total_volume = tank_length * tank_width * tank_height
  # Volume of water
  water_volume = total_volume * fill_num / fill_den
  Answer = int(water_volume)
