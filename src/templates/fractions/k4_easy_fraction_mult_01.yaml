template: |
  {{name}} has {{numerator}}/{{denominator}} of a [chocolate bar|cake|pie].
  If [he|she] gets {{whole_number}} identical [chocolate bars|cakes|pies], how much will [he|she] have in total?

solution: |
  from math import gcd

  # Multiply fraction by whole number: multiply numerator by whole number
  result_numerator = numerator * whole_number

  # Simplify
  common_divisor = gcd(result_numerator, denominator)
  final_numerator = result_numerator // common_divisor
  final_denominator = denominator // common_divisor

  Answer = (final_numerator, final_denominator)
