template: |
  A {{container_type}} can hold {{volume}} cubic centimeters.
  If the {{container_type}} has a length of {{length}} cm and width of {{width}} cm, what is its height?

solution: |
  # Volume = length × width × height
  # height = volume / (length × width)
  height = volume // (length * width)
  Answer = height
