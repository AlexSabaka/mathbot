template: |
  {{name}}'s garden is shaped like a rectangle with dimensions {{length}} feet by {{width}} feet. If {{name}} wants to cover the entire garden with mulch, and one bag of mulch covers {{coverage}} square feet, how many bags does {{name}} need?

solution: |
  # Calculate area of garden
  garden_area = length * width
  # Calculate bags needed (round up)
  import math
  bags_needed = math.ceil(garden_area / coverage)
  Answer = bags_needed
