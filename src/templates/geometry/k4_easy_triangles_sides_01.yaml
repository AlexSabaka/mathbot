  A triangle has sides measuring {{side1}} cm, {{side2}} cm, and {{side3}} cm.
  What type of triangle is it? (equilateral, isosceles, or scalene)

solution: |
  # Check if all three sides are equal
  if side1 == side2 == side3:
      Answer = "equilateral"
  # Check if exactly two sides are equal
  elif side1 == side2 or side1 == side3 or side2 == side3:
      Answer = "isosceles"
  # All sides are different
  else:
      Answer = "scalene"
