template: |
  {{name}} has a rectangular yard that is {{length}} feet by {{width}} feet.
  Fencing costs ${{fence_price}} per foot and grass seed costs ${{grass_price}} per square foot.
  What is the total cost to fence and seed the entire yard?

solution: |
  # Calculate perimeter for fencing
  perimeter = 2 * (length + width)
  fence_cost = perimeter * fence_price
  
  # Calculate area for grass
  area = length * width
  grass_cost = area * grass_price
  
  # Total cost
  total_cost = fence_cost + grass_cost
  Answer = float(total_cost)

tests:
  - seed: 99999
    expected:
      answer: "$2016.00"
  
  - seed: 11223
    expected:
      answer: "$1640.00"
