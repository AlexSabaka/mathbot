  difficulty: medium
  steps: 2
  tags: [factoring, gcf, variable_common]

variables:
  var:
    type: string
    choices: [x, y, n]
  a:
    type: integer
    min: 3
    max: 12
  b:
    type: integer
    min: 2
    max: 10
  Answer:
    type: string

template: |
  Factor completely: {{a}}{{var}} + {{a * b}}

solution: |
  # GCF is a
  # Factor: a(var + b)
  Answer = f"{a}({var} + {b})"
