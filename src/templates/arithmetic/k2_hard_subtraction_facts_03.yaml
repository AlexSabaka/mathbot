    type: string

template: |
  {{name_1}} solved {{num_a}} - {{num_b}} and got {{num_a - num_b}}.
  
  {{name_2}} solved {{num_c}} - {{num_d}} and got {{num_c - num_d}}.
  
  Who got the larger answer? By how much?
  
  Please solve this problem.

solution: |
  result_1 = num_a - num_b
  result_2 = num_c - num_d
  
  if result_1 > result_2:
      difference = result_1 - result_2
      Answer = f"{name_1} by {difference}"
  elif result_2 > result_1:
      difference = result_2 - result_1
      Answer = f"{name_2} by {difference}"
  else:
      Answer = "Both got the same answer"
