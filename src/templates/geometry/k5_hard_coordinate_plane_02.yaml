template: |
  On a coordinate plane, {{name}}'s {{place1}} is at ({{x1}}, {{y1}}), the {{place2}} is at ({{x2}}, {{y2}}), and the {{place3}} is at ({{x3}}, {{y3}}).
  
  If {{name}} can only walk horizontally or vertically, calculate the total distance from the {{place1}} to the {{place2}}, then from the {{place2}} to the {{place3}}, and then from the {{place3}} back to the {{place1}}. Give each distance separately.

solution: |
  # Distance from place1 to place2
  dist1 = abs(x2 - x1) + abs(y2 - y1)
  
  # Distance from place2 to place3
  dist2 = abs(x3 - x2) + abs(y3 - y2)
  
  # Distance from place3 to place1
  dist3 = abs(x1 - x3) + abs(y1 - y3)
  
  Answer1 = dist1
  Answer2 = dist2
  Answer3 = dist3
