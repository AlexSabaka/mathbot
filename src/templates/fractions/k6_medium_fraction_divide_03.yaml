template: |
  A recipe uses {{a}}/{{b}} cup of {{item}}. If you have {{c}}/{{d}} cup, how many batches of the recipe can you make?

solution: |
  from math import gcd
  
  # Division: (c/d) ÷ (a/b) = (c*b)/(d*a)
  numerator = c * b
  denominator = d * a
  
  # Simplify
  common = gcd(numerator, denominator)
  Answer = (numerator // common, denominator // common)
