  Answer:
    type: integer

template: |
  {{name}}'s {{object_a}} is {{length_a}} cm long. {% if name[-1] == 's' %}{{name}}'{% else %}{{name}}'s{% endif %} {{object_b}} is {{length_b}} cm long.
  
  How much longer is the {% if length_a > length_b %}{{object_a}}{% else %}{{object_b}}{% endif %}?
  
  Please solve this problem.

solution: |
  # Find the difference between the two lengths
  Answer = abs(length_a - length_b)
