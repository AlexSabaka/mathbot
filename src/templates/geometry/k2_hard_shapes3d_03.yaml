variables:
  name:
    type: person
  shape_a:
    type: string
    choices: [cylinder, cone]
  shape_b:
    type: string
    choices: [cube, sphere]
  Answer:
    type: string

template: |
  {{name}} has a {{shape_a}} and a {{shape_b}}. Both shapes can roll. A {{shape_a}} has a curved surface and a {{shape_b}} {% if shape_b == 'sphere' %}has a curved surface{% else %}has flat faces{% endif %}. What shape has both a curved surface and at least one flat face?

solution: |
  # Cylinder and cone both have curved surfaces and flat faces
  # Answer depends on which was mentioned
  if shape_a == 'cylinder':
      Answer = "cylinder"
  else:
      Answer = "cone"
