template: |
  A warehouse needs to ship {{total_items}} items. Each shipping crate can hold {{crate_size}} items. How many crates are required? How many items will be in the last crate if it's not completely full?

solution: |
  # Calculate crates needed (ceiling division)
  full_crates = total_items // crate_size
  items_in_last = total_items % crate_size
  
  # If there's a remainder, we need one more crate
  if items_in_last > 0:
    total_crates = full_crates + 1
    Answer = f"{total_crates} crates required | {items_in_last} items in last crate"
  else:
    Answer = f"{full_crates} crates required | 0 items in last crate"

      answer: "15 crates required | 4 items in last crate"

    expected:
      answer: "12 crates required | 1 items in last crate"
