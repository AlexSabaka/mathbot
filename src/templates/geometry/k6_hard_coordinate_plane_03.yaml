template: |
  {{name}} draws a rectangle on a coordinate plane. The bottom-left corner is at ({{x_corner}}, {{y_corner}}) and the top-right corner is at ({{x_corner + rect_width}}, {{y_corner + rect_height}}).
  
  Find the perimeter and area of {{name}}'s rectangle.

solution: |
  perimeter = 2 * (rect_width + rect_height)
  area = rect_width * rect_height
  Answer1 = perimeter
  Answer2 = area
