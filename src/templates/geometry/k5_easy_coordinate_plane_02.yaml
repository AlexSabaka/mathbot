variables:
  x_coord:
    type: integer
    min: -9
    max: -1
  
  y_coord:
    type: integer
    min: 1
    max: 9
  
  Answer:
    type: string

template: |
  Plot the point ({{x_coord}}, {{y_coord}}) on a coordinate plane.
  
  In which quadrant is it located?

solution: |
  # Determine quadrant based on coordinates
  if x_coord > 0 and y_coord > 0:
      Answer = "Quadrant I"
  elif x_coord < 0 and y_coord > 0:
      Answer = "Quadrant II"
  elif x_coord < 0 and y_coord < 0:
      Answer = "Quadrant III"
  else:  # x_coord > 0 and y_coord < 0
      Answer = "Quadrant IV"
