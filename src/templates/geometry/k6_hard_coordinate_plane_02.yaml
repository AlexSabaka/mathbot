template: |
  A square has one vertex at ({{x_start}}, {{y_start}}) and another vertex at ({{x_start + side_length}}, {{y_start}}).
  
  If the square extends upward from these points, what is the perimeter and area of the square?

solution: |
  perimeter = 4 * side_length
  area = side_length * side_length
  Answer1 = perimeter
  Answer2 = area
