template: |
  {{name}} has {{n}} stickers and wants to arrange them in equal rows. What are all the possible ways {{name}} can arrange the stickers so each row has the same number?

solution: |
  # Find all factors (number of rows possible)

  for i in range(1, n + 1):
    if n % i == 0:
      factors.append(i)
  
  # Format as "1 row, 2 rows, ..." or just list the numbers
  Answer = ", ".join(str(f) for f in factors)
