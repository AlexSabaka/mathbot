template: |
  {{name1}} built a storage shed that is {{l1}} feet × {{w1}} feet × {{h1}} feet.
  {{name2}} built a storage shed that is {{l2}} feet × {{w2}} feet × {{h2}} feet.
  Calculate the volume of each shed, and find which one is larger.

solution: |
  volume1 = l1 * w1 * h1
  volume2 = l2 * w2 * h2
  
  Answer1 = volume1
  Answer2 = volume2
