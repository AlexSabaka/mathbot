  Answer:
    type: integer
    format: area

template: |
  A composite shape is made from two rectangles placed side by side.
  
  Rectangle A measures {{length_a}} ft by {{width_a}} ft.
  Rectangle B measures {{length_b}} ft by {{width_b}} ft.
  
  Calculate the total area.

solution: |
  area_a = length_a * width_a
  area_b = length_b * width_b
  Answer = area_a + area_b
