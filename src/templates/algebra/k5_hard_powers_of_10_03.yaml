  Answer:
    type: integer

template: |
  A road from {{location1}} is {{digit1}} × 10^{{exp1}} {{measurement}} long. A road from {{location2}} is {{digit2}} × 10^{{exp2}} {{measurement}} long. Which road is longer and by how much?

solution: |
  length1 = digit1 * (10 ** exp1)
  length2 = digit2 * (10 ** exp2)
  Answer = abs(length1 - length2)
