variables:
  name1:
    type: person
  name2:
    type: person
  a:
    type: integer
    min: 3
    max: 6
  b:
    type: integer

    max: 8
  Answer:
    type: integer

template: |
  {{name1}} counts by {{a}}s starting from {{a}}.
  {{name2}} counts by {{b}}s starting from {{b}}.
  What is the smallest number they will BOTH say?

solution: |
  # Find LCM by checking multiples of a
  lcm = None
  for i in range(1, 100):
    multiple_a = a * i
    if multiple_a % b == 0:
      lcm = multiple_a
      break

  Answer = lcm
