  How is a {{shape_a}} different from a {{shape_b}}? Name 1 difference.

solution: |
  shape_sides = {
      'triangle': 3,
      'square': 4,
      'rectangle': 4,
      'pentagon': 5,
      'hexagon': 6
  }
  sides_a = shape_sides[shape_a]
  sides_b = shape_sides[shape_b]
  
  if sides_a != sides_b:
      Answer = f"A {shape_a} has {sides_a} sides; a {shape_b} has {sides_b} sides"
  elif shape_a == 'square' and shape_b == 'rectangle':
      Answer = "A square has all equal sides; a rectangle has 2 pairs of equal sides"
  else:
      Answer = f"A {shape_a} and {shape_b} have different properties"
