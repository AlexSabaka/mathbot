template: |
  A homeowner is renovating their {{ "kitchen|bathroom|living room|bedroom|hallway" | choice }}, which measures {{room_length}}m by {{room_width}}m.
  
  They've chosen square tiles that are {{tile_size}}m × {{tile_size}}m.
  
  {% if add_waste %}The contractor recommends ordering {{waste_percent}}% extra tiles to account for cuts and breakage.
  
  How many tiles should be ordered in total?{% else %}How many tiles are needed to cover the floor?{% endif %}
  
  Please solve this problem and provide your final answer.

solution: |
  room_area = room_length * room_width
  tile_area = tile_size * tile_size
  tiles_needed = room_area / tile_area
  if add_waste:
      tiles_with_waste = tiles_needed * (1 + waste_percent / 100)
      Answer = int(round(tiles_with_waste))
  else:
      Answer = int(round(tiles_needed))
