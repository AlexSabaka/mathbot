template: |
  A parallelogram has a base of {{base}} cm and a height of {{height}} cm.
  If both the base and height are increased by {{increase}} cm, by how many square centimeters does the area increase?

solution: |
  # Original area
  original_area = base * height
  
  # New dimensions
  new_base = base + increase
  new_height = height + increase
  new_area = new_base * new_height
  
  # Difference
  increase_in_area = new_area - original_area
  Answer = increase_in_area
