    type: string

template: |
  Which expression is NOT equivalent to the others?
  
  A) {{a}}({{var}} + {{b}})
  B) {{a}}{{var}} + {{a * b}}
  C) {{c}}{{var}} + {{d}}

solution: |
  # A and B are equivalent: a(x + b) = ax + ab
  # C is different if c != a or d != ab
  if c == a and d == a * b:
      Answer = "A and B are equivalent to C"
  else:
      Answer = "C"
