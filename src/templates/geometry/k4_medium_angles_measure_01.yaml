template: |
  {{name}} draws an angle that is {{diff}} degrees {{more_or_less}} than a right angle.
  What is the measure of {{name}}'s angle?
  What type of angle is it?

solution: |
  if more_or_less == "more":
      Answer1 = 90 + diff
  else:
      Answer1 = 90 - diff

  if Answer1 < 90:
      Answer2 = "acute"
  elif Answer1 == 90:
      Answer2 = "right"
  elif Answer1 < 180:
      Answer2 = "obtuse"
  else:
      Answer2 = "straight"
