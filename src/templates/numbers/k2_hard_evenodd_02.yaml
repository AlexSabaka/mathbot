  What is the largest {{parity}} number less than {{limit}}?

solution: |
  if parity == 'even':
      if (limit - 1) % 2 == 0:
          Answer = limit - 1
      else:
          Answer = limit - 2
  else:  # odd
      if (limit - 1) % 2 == 1:
          Answer = limit - 1
      else:
          Answer = limit - 2
