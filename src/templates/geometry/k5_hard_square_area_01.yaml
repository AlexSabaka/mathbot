template: |
  {{name}} has a square pool with an area of {{pool_side * pool_side}} square meters.
  {{name}} wants to build a deck around it that is {{deck_width}} meters wide on all sides.
  What is the area of just the deck?

solution: |
  # Calculate the pool's side length (already given as pool_side)
  pool_area = pool_side * pool_side
  
  # Calculate the outer square (pool + deck)
  outer_side = pool_side + (2 * deck_width)
  outer_area = outer_side * outer_side
  
  # Deck area = outer area - pool area
  deck_area = outer_area - pool_area
  Answer = deck_area
