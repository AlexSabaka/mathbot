template: |
  A rectangular {{area_type}} is {{length}} meters by {{width}} meters.
  A pond measuring {{feature_length}} meters by {{feature_width}} meters is in the center.
  If grass seed costs ${{price}} per square meter, how much will it cost to cover the {{area_type}} excluding the pond?

solution: |
  # Calculate total area
  total_area = length * width
  
  # Calculate pond area
  pond_area = feature_length * feature_width
  
  # Calculate grass area
  grass_area = total_area - pond_area
  
  # Calculate cost
  total_cost = grass_area * price
  Answer = float(total_cost)
