template: |
  Three swimmers competed in a race. {{name1}} swam {{num1}}/{{denom1}} of a mile, {{name2}} swam {{dec}} of a mile, and {{name3}} swam {{num2}}/{{denom2}} of a mile. Who swam the longest distance? Who swam the shortest distance?

solution: |
  # Convert to decimals
  dist1 = num1 / denom1
  dist2 = dec
  dist3 = num2 / denom2
  
  # Create list of (distance, name) tuples
  distances = [
    (dist1, name1),
    (dist2, name2),
    (dist3, name3)
  ]
  
  # Sort by distance
  distances.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])
  
  # Shortest is first, longest is last
  shortest = distances[0][1]
  longest = distances[2][1]
  
  Answer = f"{longest} swam the longest distance | {shortest} swam the shortest distance"
