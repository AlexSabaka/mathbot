  A truck can carry a maximum of {{max_weight}} pounds. {{name}} wants to load {{item}} that each weigh {{weight_per_item}} pounds. Write and solve an inequality to find how many {{item}} the truck can carry. Graph the solution.

solution: |
  # Let x = number of items
  # weight_per_item * x ≤ max_weight
  # x ≤ max_weight / weight_per_item
  max_items = max_weight // weight_per_item
  Answer = f"The truck can carry at most {max_items} {item}. Solution: x ≤ {max_items}, graphed as all whole numbers from 0 to {max_items}"
