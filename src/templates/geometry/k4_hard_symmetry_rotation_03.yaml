template: |
  {{name}} designs a logo with rotational symmetry of order {{num_symmetries}}.

  a) What is the angle of rotation?
  b) If {{name}} also wants {{num_symmetries}} lines of symmetry, what shape could the logo be based on?

solution: |
  # a) Angle of rotation
  Answer1 = 360 // num_symmetries

  # b) Number of lines of symmetry (for regular polygon with n sides = n)
  Answer2 = num_symmetries
