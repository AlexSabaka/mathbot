  var:
    type: string
    choices: [s, x]
  a:
    type: integer
    min: 2
    max: 6

  Answer:
    type: string

template: |
  A square has side length {{var}}. A rectangle has length {{a}}{{var}} and width {{b}}. Write an expression for the combined area of both shapes.

solution: |
  # Square area: var^2
  # Rectangle area: a*var * b = a*b*var
  combined_coefficient = a * b
  Answer = f"{var}^2 + {combined_coefficient}{var}"
