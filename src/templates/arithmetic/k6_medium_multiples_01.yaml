template: |
  A bus arrives at the station every {{a}} minutes. Another bus arrives every {{b}} minutes. If both buses arrive at {{hour}}:{{minute}}, when will they next arrive at the same time?

solution: |
  # Find LCM to get the time when both arrive together
  lcm = abs(a * b) // math.gcd(a, b)
  
  # Calculate new time
  total_minutes = hour * 60 + lcm
  new_hour = total_minutes // 60
  new_minute = total_minutes % 60
  
  # Format time
  if new_hour > 12:
    new_hour = new_hour - 12
    period = "PM"
  elif new_hour == 12:
    period = "PM"
  else:
    period = "AM"
  
  Answer = f"{new_hour}:{new_minute:02d} {period}"
