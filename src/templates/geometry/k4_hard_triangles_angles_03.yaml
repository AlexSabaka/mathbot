  Answer:
    type: integer

template: |
  In a right triangle, one of the acute angles is {{acute_angle}} degrees.
  What is the measure of the other acute angle?

solution: |
  # In a right triangle, one angle is 90 degrees
  # The sum of all angles is 180 degrees
  # So the two acute angles sum to 90 degrees
  other_acute_angle = 90 - acute_angle
  Answer = other_acute_angle
