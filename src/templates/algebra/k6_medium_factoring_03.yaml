variables:
  var:
    type: string
    choices: [x, y, n]
  gcf:
    type: integer
    min: 2
    max: 5
  a:
    type: integer

  Answer:
    type: string

template: |
  Factor out the greatest common factor: {{gcf * a}}{{var}} + {{gcf * b}}{{var}} + {{gcf * c}}

solution: |
  # GCF is gcf
  # Factor: gcf((a+b)*var + c)
  combined_coeff = a + b
  Answer = f"{gcf}({combined_coeff}{var} + {c})"
