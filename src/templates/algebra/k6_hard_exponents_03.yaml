  A scientist observes that a cell culture doubles every day. If there are {{initial_cells}} cells initially, write an expression using exponents to represent the number of cells after {{time_periods}} days. Then calculate the total number of cells.

solution: |
  # Expression: initial * 2^days
  expression = f"{initial_cells} × 2^{time_periods}"
  
  # Calculate result
  result = initial_cells * (2 ** time_periods)
  
  Answer = f"{expression} | {result}"
