  Answer:
    type: integer
    format: area

template: |
  {{name1}} has a rhombus kite with diagonals {{d1a}} inches and {{d1b}} inches.
  {{name2}} has a rhombus kite with diagonals {{d2a}} inches and {{d2b}} inches.
  How much larger is the bigger kite?

solution: |
  area1 = (d1a * d1b) / 2
  area2 = (d2a * d2b) / 2
  difference = int(abs(area1 - area2))
  Answer = difference
