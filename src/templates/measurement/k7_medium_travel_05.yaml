  Answer:
    type: time

template: |
  {{name}} is flying from {{city1}} to {{city2}} for a business trip.
  
  The flight covers {{distance1}} miles at a cruising speed of {{speed1}} mph.
  
  {% if has_layover %}With a {{layover_hours}}-hour layover in {{city2}}, they continue their journey. {% endif %}
  
  {% if has_second_flight %}{{name}} then flies to {{city3}}, covering another {{distance2}} miles at {{speed2}} mph.{% endif %}
  
  What's the total travel time?

solution: |
  flight_time1 = distance1 / speed1
  if has_layover:
      layover_time = layover_hours
  else:
      layover_time = 0
  if has_second_flight:
      flight_time2 = distance2 / speed2
  else:
      flight_time2 = 0
  total_time = flight_time1 + layover_time + flight_time2
  Answer = round(total_time, 2)
