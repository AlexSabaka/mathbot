  Each student in a class needs {{numerator}}/{{denominator}} of a meter of string for a project.
  If there are {{students}} students, how much string is needed in total?

solution: |
  # Multiply whole number by numerator
  result_numerator = students * numerator
  
  # Simplify the fraction
  common = math.gcd(result_numerator, denominator)
  final_num = result_numerator // common
  final_den = denominator // common
  
  Answer = (final_num, final_den)
