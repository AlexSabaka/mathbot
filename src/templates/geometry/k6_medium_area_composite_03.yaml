template: |
  A room is {{room_length}} feet by {{room_width}} feet. A rectangular rug measuring {{rug_length}} feet by {{rug_width}} feet covers part of the floor.
  
  How much floor area is NOT covered by the rug?

solution: |
  room_area = room_length * room_width
  rug_area = rug_length * rug_width
  uncovered = room_area - rug_area
  Answer = uncovered
