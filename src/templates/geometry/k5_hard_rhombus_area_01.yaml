template: |
  A rhombus has diagonals of {{diagonal1}} cm and {{diagonal2}} cm.
  Each side is {{side}} cm long. Find both the area and the perimeter of the rhombus.

solution: |
  # Area = (diagonal1 × diagonal2) / 2
  area = (diagonal1 * diagonal2) / 2
  
  # Perimeter = 4 × side (all sides equal in rhombus)
  perimeter = 4 * side
  
  Answer1 = int(area)
  Answer2 = perimeter
