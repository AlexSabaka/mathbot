    type: integer

template: |
  {{name}} has a {{shape_a}} and a {{shape_b}}. How many total sides do both shapes have together?

solution: |
  shape_sides = {
      'triangle': 3,
      'square': 4,
      'rectangle': 4,
      'pentagon': 5,
      'hexagon': 6
  }
  total_sides = shape_sides[shape_a] + shape_sides[shape_b]
  Answer = total_sides
