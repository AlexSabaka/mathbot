template: |
  A {{business}} charges ${{base_fee}} plus ${{rate}} per {{unit}}. Write an expression for the total cost of {{variable}} {{unit}}s, then calculate the cost for {{specific_value}} {{unit}}s.

solution: |
  Answer1 = f"{base_fee} + {rate}{variable}"
  total_cost = base_fee + (rate * specific_value)
  Answer2 = round(total_cost, 2)
