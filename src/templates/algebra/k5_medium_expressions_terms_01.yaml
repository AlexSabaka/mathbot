variables:
  name:
    type: person
  age_diff:
    type: integer
    min: 2
    max: 8
  relationship:
    type: string
    choices: ["brother", "sister", "cousin", "friend"]

  Answer1:
    type: string
  Answer2:
    type: string
  Answer3:
    type: string

template: |
  Write an algebraic expression for: {{name}} is {{age_diff}} years older than {% if relationship == "sister" %}her{% else %}his{% endif %} {{relationship}}, who is {{variable}} years old. Then identify the coefficient and the constant.

solution: |
  Answer1 = f"{variable} + {age_diff}"
  Answer2 = "1"
  Answer3 = str(age_diff)
