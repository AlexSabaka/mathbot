variables:
  name:
    type: person
  item:
    type: string
    choices: ["tickets", "books", "toys", "games"]
  a:
    type: integer
    min: 3
    max: 8
  b:
    type: integer
    min: 5
    max: 15
  total:
    type: integer
    min: 40
    max: 100
  Answer:
    type: string

template: |
  {{name}} wants to buy {{item}}. Each {{item[:-1]}} costs ${{a}}, and {{name}} also needs to pay a ${{b}} shipping fee. If {{name}} has ${{total}}, write and solve an inequality to find the maximum number of {{item}} {{name}} can buy.

solution: |
  # Let x = number of items
  # a*x + b ≤ total
  # a*x ≤ total - b
  # x ≤ (total - b) / a
  max_items = (total - b) // a
  Answer = f"{name} can buy at most {max_items} {item}. Solution: x ≤ {max_items}"
