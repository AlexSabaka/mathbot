template: |
  A {{relation}} worth {{total_formatted}} is divided among 3 heirs according to specific percentages.
  
  {% set pct2 = (100 - pct1) // 2 %}
  {% set pct3 = 100 - pct1 - pct2 %}
  {{name1}} receives {{pct1}}%, {{name2}} receives {{pct2}}%, and {{name3}} receives {{pct3}}%.
  
  How much does each heir receive?

solution: |
  # Calculate pct2 and pct3 the same way as template
  pct2 = (100 - pct1) // 2
  pct3 = 100 - pct1 - pct2
  
  amount1 = total * (pct1 / 100)
  amount2 = total * (pct2 / 100)
  amount3 = total * (pct3 / 100)
  
  Answer1 = round(amount1, 2)
  Answer2 = round(amount2, 2)
  Answer3 = round(amount3, 2)
