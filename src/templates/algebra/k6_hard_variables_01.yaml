variables:
  var:
    type: string
    choices: [L, x]
  a:
    type: integer
    min: 2
    max: 8
  Answer1:
    type: string
  Answer2:
    type: string

template: |
  The length of a rectangle is {{var}} and the width is {{a}} less than the length. Write expressions for the perimeter and area of the rectangle.

solution: |
  # Perimeter: 2(L + W) where W = L - a
  # P = 2(var + (var - a)) = 2(2*var - a) = 4*var - 2*a
  Answer1 = f"4{var} - {2*a}"
  
  # Area: L * W where W = L - a
  # A = var * (var - a) = var^2 - a*var
  Answer2 = f"{var}^2 - {a}{var}"
