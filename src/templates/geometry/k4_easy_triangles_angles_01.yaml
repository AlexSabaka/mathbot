  Answer:
    type: string

template: |
  A triangle has angles measuring {{angle1}}°, {{angle2}}°, and a third angle.
  What type of triangle is it based on its angles? (acute, right, or obtuse)

solution: |
  # Calculate the third angle
  angle3 = 180 - angle1 - angle2

  # Classify by angles
  if angle1 == 90 or angle2 == 90 or angle3 == 90:
      Answer = "right"
  elif angle1 > 90 or angle2 > 90 or angle3 > 90:
      Answer = "obtuse"
  else:
      # All angles less than 90
      Answer = "acute"
