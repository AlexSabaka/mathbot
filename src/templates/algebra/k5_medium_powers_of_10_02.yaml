variables:
  multiplier:
    type: integer
    min: 100
    max: 900
    step: 100
  power_of_ten:
    type: integer

  Answer:
    type: string

template: |
  Express {{multiplier * (10 ** power_of_ten)}} as a product of a single digit and a power of 10.

solution: |
  # Calculate the number first
  number = multiplier * (10 ** power_of_ten)
  
  # Find single digit representation
  digit = multiplier // 100
  total_power = power_of_ten + 2
  Answer = f"{digit} × 10^{total_power}"
