  Three cyclists complete their laps in {{a}}, {{b}}, and {{c}} minutes respectively. If they start together, after how many minutes will they all meet at the starting point again?

solution: |
  # Find LCM of three numbers
  lcm_ab = abs(a * b) // math.gcd(a, b)
  lcm_abc = abs(lcm_ab * c) // math.gcd(lcm_ab, c)
  
  Answer = lcm_abc
