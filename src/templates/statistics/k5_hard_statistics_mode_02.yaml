  Answer:
    type: string

template: |
  The data set {{mode1}}, {{mode2}}, {{num1}}, {{mode1}}, {{mode2}} has two modes.
  If we add the number {{mode1}} to the set, will it still have two modes?

solution: |
  # After adding mode1, it will appear 3 times while mode2 appears 2 times
  # So it will have only one mode (mode1)
