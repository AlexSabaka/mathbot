  A theater has {{a}} sections.
  Each section has {{b}} seats in the lower level and {{c}} seats in the upper level.
  Use the distributive property to find the total number of seats.
  Write the equation and solve.

solution: |
  # Apply distributive property: a × (b + c) = (a × b) + (a × c)
  seats_per_section = b + c
  lower_total = a * b
  upper_total = a * c
  total_seats = lower_total + upper_total

  Answer = f"Equation: {a} × ({b} + {c}) = ({a} × {b}) + ({a} × {c}). Solution: ({a} × {b}) + ({a} × {c}) = {lower_total} + {upper_total} = {total_seats} seats total."

      answer: "Equation: 8 × (45 + 32) = (8 × 45) + (8 × 32). Solution: (8 × 45) + (8 × 32) = 360 + 256 = 616 seats total."

      answer: "Equation: 9 × (42 + 28) = (9 × 42) + (9 × 28). Solution: (9 × 42) + (9 × 28) = 378 + 252 = 630 seats total."
