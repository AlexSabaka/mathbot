template: |
  {{name}} draws a rectangle on a coordinate plane.
  One corner is at ({{x1}}, {{y1}}).
  The rectangle has a width of {{width}} units and a height of {{height}} units.
  
  What are the coordinates of the opposite corner (give x-coordinate and y-coordinate)? What is the area of the rectangle?

solution: |
  # Calculate opposite corner coordinates
  x2 = x1 + width
  y2 = y1 + height
  
  # Calculate area
  area = width * height
  
  Answer1 = x2
  Answer2 = y2
  Answer3 = area
