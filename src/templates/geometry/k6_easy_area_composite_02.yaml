template: |
  {{name}} combines two rectangular pieces of paper.
  
  The first rectangle is {{rect1_l}} cm by {{rect1_w}} cm.
  The second rectangle is {{rect2_l}} cm by {{rect2_w}} cm.
  
  What is the total area?

solution: |
  area1 = rect1_l * rect1_w
  area2 = rect2_l * rect2_w
  total = area1 + area2
