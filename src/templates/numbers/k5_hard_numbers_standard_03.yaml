template: |
  One {{region1}} has a population of "{{(millions1 * 1000000 + thousands1)|number_to_words}}." Another {{region2}} has "{{(millions2 * 1000000 + thousands2)|number_to_words}}" people. Write both numbers in standard form and find the total population.

solution: |
  pop1 = millions1 * 1000000 + thousands1
  pop2 = millions2 * 1000000 + thousands2
  Answer = pop1 + pop2
