template: |
  A trapezoidal {{object}} has parallel sides of {{base1}} cm and {{base2}} cm.
  If the area is {{area}} square cm, what is the height?

solution: |
  # Area = ((base1 + base2) × height) / 2
  # height = (2 × area) / (base1 + base2)
  height = (2 * area) // (base1 + base2)
  Answer = height
