template: |
  {{name}} needs to divide {{a}} by {{b}}/{{c}}. Explain how finding the reciprocal of {{b}}/{{c}} helps solve this problem. Then calculate the answer.

solution: |
  from math import gcd
  
  # Dividing by a fraction is the same as multiplying by its reciprocal
  # a ÷ (b/c) = a × (c/b) = (a*c)/b
  
  numerator = a * c
  denominator = b
  
  # Simplify
  common = gcd(numerator, denominator)
  Answer = (numerator // common, denominator // common)
