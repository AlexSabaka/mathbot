template: |
  {{name}} bought {{item}}. [He|She] used {{numerator1}}/{{denominator}} for breakfast and {{numerator2}}/{{denominator}} for lunch.
  What fraction did {{name}} use in total?

solution: |
  # Same denominator addition: add numerators, keep denominator
  total_numerator = numerator1 + numerator2

  # Check if we need to simplify or convert to mixed number
  if total_numerator >= denominator:
      # Keep as improper fraction, system will handle simplification
      Answer = (total_numerator, denominator)
  else:
      Answer = (total_numerator, denominator)
