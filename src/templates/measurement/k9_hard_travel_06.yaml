template: |
  {{name}} is driving from {{city1}} to {{city2}}, a total distance of {{total_distance}} miles. They drive the first part at {{speed1}} mph for {{time1}} hours, then reduce their speed to {{speed2}} mph for the remainder of the trip. How long does the entire journey take?

solution: |
  distance1 = speed1 * time1
  remaining_distance = total_distance - distance1
  time2 = remaining_distance / speed2
  total_time = time1 + time2
  Answer = round(total_time, 2)
