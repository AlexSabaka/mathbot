  In the division problem {{dividend}} ÷ {{divisor}} = {{quotient}} R {{remainder}}, identify:
  a) The dividend
  b) The divisor
  c) The quotient
  d) The remainder

solution: |
  # Set dividend and divisor for display
  dividend = number1
  divisor = number2

  # Calculate quotient and remainder
  quotient = number1 // number2
  remainder = number1 % number2

  # Set answers (dividend, divisor, quotient, remainder)
  Answer1 = dividend
  Answer2 = divisor
  Answer3 = quotient
  Answer4 = remainder
