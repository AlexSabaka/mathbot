  Convert the improper fraction {{numerator}}/{{denominator}} to a mixed number.

solution: |
  # Ensure it's actually improper
  if numerator < denominator:
      numerator = denominator + 3

  # Calculate whole part and remainder
  whole = numerator // denominator
  remainder = numerator % denominator

  # Format as mixed number
  if remainder == 0:
      Answer = str(whole)
  else:
      Answer = f"{whole} {remainder}/{denominator}"
