variables:
  var:
    type: string
    choices: [x, n]
  a:
    type: integer
    min: 2
    max: 10
  b:
    type: integer
    min: 5
    max: 20
  Answer:
    type: string

template: |
  Solve and graph: {{var}} + {{a}} ≤ {{b}}
  
  Describe the solution.

solution: |
  # Subtract a from both sides
  result = b - a
  Answer = f"{var} ≤ {result}, meaning all numbers less than or equal to {result}"
