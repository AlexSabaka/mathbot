template: |
  A rectangular {{room_type}} has an area of {{area}} square feet and a length of {{length}} feet.
  What is the width and perimeter?

solution: |
  # Area = length × width, so width = area / length
  width = area // length
  
  # Perimeter = 2 × (length + width)
  perimeter = 2 * (length + width)
  
  Answer1 = width
  Answer2 = perimeter
