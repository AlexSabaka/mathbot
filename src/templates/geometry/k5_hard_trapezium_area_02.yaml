    type: integer
    format: area

template: |
  {{name1}} has a trapezoidal garden with parallel sides {{b1a}} feet and {{b2a}} feet, and height {{ha}} feet.
  {{name2}} has a trapezoidal garden with parallel sides {{b1b}} feet and {{b2b}} feet, and height {{hb}} feet.
  What is the difference in their areas?

solution: |
  area1 = ((b1a + b2a) * ha) / 2
  area2 = ((b1b + b2b) * hb) / 2
  difference = int(abs(area1 - area2))
  Answer = difference
