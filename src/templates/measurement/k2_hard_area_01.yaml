template: |
  {{name}} wants to cover a {{object}} that is {{length}} cm by {{width}} cm with square tiles that are {{tile_size}} cm on each side.
  
  How many tiles does {% if name[-1].lower() in ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'] %}{{name}}{% else %}{{name}}{% endif %} need?
  
  Please solve this problem.

solution: |
  # Calculate area and divide by tile area
  total_area = length * width
  tile_area = tile_size * tile_size
  Answer = total_area // tile_area
