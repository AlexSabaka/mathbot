  A recipe calls for {{a}}/{{b}} cup of flour. {{name}} wants to make {{n}} batches. How much flour is needed? Express your answer in simplest form.

solution: |
  from math import gcd
  
  # Multiply: (a/b) * n = (a*n)/b
  numerator = a * n
  denominator = b
  
  # Simplify
  common = gcd(numerator, denominator)
  Answer = (numerator // common, denominator // common)
