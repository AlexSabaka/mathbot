template: |
  {{name}} has a parallelogram-shaped patio with a base of {{base}} meters and a height of {{height}} meters. {{name}} wants to tile the patio, and each box of tiles covers {{tile_coverage}} square meters.
  
  How many boxes of tiles does {{name}} need?

  import math
  # Area of parallelogram
  patio_area = base * height
  # Boxes needed (round up)
  boxes = math.ceil(patio_area / tile_coverage)
  Answer = boxes
