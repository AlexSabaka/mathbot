template: |
  On a coordinate plane, {{name}}'s {{place1}} is at ({{x1}}, {{y1}}).
  The {{place2}} is at ({{x2}}, {{y2}}).
  
  How many units right (or left if negative) and how many units up (or down if negative) must {{name}} move?

solution: |
  # Calculate horizontal and vertical movements
  horizontal = x2 - x1
  vertical = y2 - y1
  
  Answer1 = horizontal
  Answer2 = vertical
