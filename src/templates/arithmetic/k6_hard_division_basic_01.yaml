variables:
  daily_production:
    type: integer

    max: 500
  box_capacity:
    type: integer

  Answer:
    type: string

template: |
  A factory produces {{daily_production}} items per day. If each box holds {{box_capacity}} items, how many boxes are needed to pack one day's production? How many items will be in the partially filled box?

solution: |
  # Calculate boxes needed (need ceiling division for packing)
  full_boxes = daily_production // box_capacity
  items_in_partial = daily_production % box_capacity
  
  # If there's a remainder, we need one more box
  if items_in_partial > 0:
    total_boxes = full_boxes + 1
    Answer = f"{total_boxes} boxes needed | {items_in_partial} items in partial box"
  else:
    Answer = f"{full_boxes} boxes needed | 0 items in partial box"
