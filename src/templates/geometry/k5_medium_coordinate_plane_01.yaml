template: |
  {{name}}'s house is at point ({{x1}}, {{y1}}) on a coordinate plane.
  The {{location}} is at point ({{x2}}, {{y2}}).
  
  What is the horizontal distance and vertical distance between them?

solution: |
  # Calculate horizontal and vertical distances
  horizontal_distance = abs(x2 - x1)
  vertical_distance = abs(y2 - y1)
  
  Answer1 = horizontal_distance
  Answer2 = vertical_distance
