    type: decimal

template: |
  A figure is made of a rectangle {{rect_length}} cm by {{rect_width}} cm with a semicircle of diameter {{rect_width}} cm attached to one end.
  
  Find the total area. (Use π ≈ 3.14)

solution: |
  # Rectangle area
  rect_area = rect_length * rect_width
  # Semicircle area: (π × r²) / 2, where r = width / 2
  radius = rect_width / 2
  semicircle_area = (3.14 * radius * radius) / 2
  # Total area
  total = rect_area + semicircle_area
  Answer = round(total, 2)
