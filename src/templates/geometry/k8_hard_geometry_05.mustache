A {{field_type}} field has a rectangular shape measuring {{length_integer_min_5_max_50}}m by {{width_integer_min_3_max_30}}m.

{{#transform_to_square}}The owner wants to redesign it as a square field with the same area.

{{#calculate_perimeter}}They need to know both the side length of the new square and its perimeter for planning the boundary.

What are the side length and perimeter of the square field?{{/calculate_perimeter}}{{^calculate_perimeter}}What is the side length of the square field?{{/calculate_perimeter}}{{/transform_to_square}}{{^transform_to_square}}What is the area of the field?{{/transform_to_square}}
