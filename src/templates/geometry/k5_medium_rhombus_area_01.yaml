template: |
  A rhombus-shaped {{object}} has an area of {{area}} square inches.
  If one diagonal is {{diagonal1}} inches, what is the length of the other diagonal?

solution: |
  # Area = (diagonal1 × diagonal2) / 2
  # diagonal2 = (2 × area) / diagonal1
  diagonal2 = (2 * area) // diagonal1
  Answer = diagonal2
