template: |
  After a meal together in {{city}}, {{name1}}, {{name2}}, and {{name3}} receive a bill totaling {{total_formatted}}. They agree to split the cost in the ratio {{ratio1}}:{{ratio2}}:{{ratio3}} based on what each person ordered. How much does each person pay?
  
  Please solve this problem and provide your final answer.

solution: |
  total_parts = ratio1 + ratio2 + ratio3
  amount1 = total * (ratio1 / total_parts)
  amount2 = total * (ratio2 / total_parts)
  amount3 = total * (ratio3 / total_parts)
  
  Answer1 = round(amount1, 2)
  Answer2 = round(amount2, 2)
  Answer3 = round(amount3, 2)
