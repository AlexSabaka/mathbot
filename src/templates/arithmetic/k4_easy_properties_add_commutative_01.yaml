variables:
  name:
    type: person
  a:
    type: integer
    min: 10

  b:
    type: integer
    min: 10
    max: 99
  Answer:
    type: string

template: |
  {{name}} says that {{a}} + {{b}} is the same as {{b}} + {{a}}.
  Is {{name}} correct? Explain why using the commutative property.

solution: |
  # Calculate both expressions
  sum1 = a + b
  sum2 = b + a

  # Both should be equal due to commutative property
  if sum1 == sum2:
      Answer = f"Yes, {name} is correct. The commutative property of addition states that changing the order of addends does not change the sum. Both {a} + {b} and {b} + {a} equal {sum1}."
  else:
      Answer = f"No, {name} is incorrect."
