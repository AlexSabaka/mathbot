template: |
  A parallelogram has a base of {{base}} cm and a side of {{side}} cm.
  What is the perimeter?
  If one angle is {{angle}}°, what are all four angles?

solution: |
  # Perimeter of parallelogram = 2(base + side)
  Answer1 = 2 * (base + side)

  # In a parallelogram, opposite angles are equal
  # Consecutive angles are supplementary (sum to 180°)
  # So if one angle is {{angle}}°, the angles are:
  # angle, (180 - angle), angle, (180 - angle)
  angle_2 = 180 - angle

  # Store all four angles
  Answer2 = angle
  Answer3 = angle_2
  Answer4 = angle
