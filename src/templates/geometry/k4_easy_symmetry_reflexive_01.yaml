template: |
  Complete the figure so it has reflexive symmetry about the {{line_type}} line.
  Starting point: ({{x1}}, {{y1}})

  What are the coordinates of the reflected point?

solution: |
  # For vertical line through origin (x=0): (x, y) -> (-x, y)
  # For horizontal line through origin (y=0): (x, y) -> (x, -y)
  if line_type == "vertical":
      Answer = f"({-x1}, {y1})"
  else:  # horizontal
      Answer = f"({x1}, {-y1})"
