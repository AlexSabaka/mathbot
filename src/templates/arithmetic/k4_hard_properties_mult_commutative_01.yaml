variables:
  name1:
    type: person
  name2:
    type: person
  a:
    type: integer
    min: 4

  Answer:
    type: string

template: |
  {{name1}} arranges {{a}} groups of {{b}} {{item}} in a room.
  {{name2}} rearranges them into {{b}} groups of {{a}}.
  Without counting, explain why both arrangements have the same total number.

solution: |
  # Calculate the total
  total = a * b

  # Explain using commutative property
  Answer = f"Both arrangements have the same total because of the commutative property of multiplication. {name1}'s arrangement: {a} × {b} = {total} {item}. {name2}'s arrangement: {b} × {a} = {total} {item}. Since {a} × {b} = {b} × {a}, both have {total} {item}."

      answer: "Both arrangements have the same total because of the commutative property of multiplication. Sarah's arrangement: 9 × 11 = 99 chairs. James's arrangement: 11 × 9 = 99 chairs. Since 9 × 11 = 11 × 9, both have 99 chairs."

      answer: "Both arrangements have the same total because of the commutative property of multiplication. James's arrangement: 11 × 4 = 44 desks. Maria's arrangement: 4 × 11 = 44 desks. Since 11 × 4 = 4 × 11, both have 44 desks."
