    type: string

template: |
  {% set rounded_value = rounded_tens * 10 %}
  {{name}} rounded a number to {{rounded_value}}. What are all the possible numbers {{ "he|she" | choice }} could have started with? (Round to nearest ten)

solution: |
  rounded_value = rounded_tens * 10
  
  # Numbers that round to rounded_value: from (rounded_value - 5) to (rounded_value + 4)
  start = max(1, rounded_value - 5)
  end = rounded_value + 4
  
  possible = [str(n) for n in range(start, end + 1)]
  Answer = ', '.join(possible)
