  Answer:
    type: string

template: |
  Plot these points and identify the shape they form: ({{x1}}, {{y1}}), ({{x1 + side}}, {{y1}}), ({{x1 + side}}, {{y1 + side}}), ({{x1}}, {{y1 + side}}).
  
  What shape is formed by connecting these points?

solution: |
  # These points form a square since all sides are equal
  Answer = "square"
