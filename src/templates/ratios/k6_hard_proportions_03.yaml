template: |
  {{name1}} can paint {{area1}} square feet in {{time1}} hours. How long will it take {{name1}} to paint {{area2}} square feet? At this rate, how many square feet can {{name1}} paint in 10 hours?

solution: |
  # First question: time to paint area2
  time_needed = (time1 * area2) / area1
  
  # Second question: area painted in 10 hours
  area_in_10_hours = (area1 * 10) / time1
  
  Answer1 = round(time_needed, 2)
  Answer2 = round(area_in_10_hours, 2)
