  Answer:
    type: integer

template: |
  {{name}} wants to find {{number1}} × {{number2}} using the area model.
  Help {{name}} break apart {{number2}} into tens and ones to solve.

solution: |
  # Break number2 into tens and ones
  tens_digit = number2 // 10
  ones_digit = number2 % 10

  # Multiply by tens part
  tens_product = number1 * (tens_digit * 10)

  # Multiply by ones part
  ones_product = number1 * ones_digit

  # Add the two products
  Answer = tens_product + ones_product
