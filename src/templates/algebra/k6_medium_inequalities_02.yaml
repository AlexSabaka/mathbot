variables:
  var:
    type: string
    choices: [x, n]
  a:
    type: integer
    min: 3
    max: 12
  b:
    type: integer
    min: 10
    max: 25
  Answer:
    type: string

template: |
  Solve and graph: {{var}} - {{a}} > {{b}}
  
  Describe the solution.

solution: |
  # Add a to both sides
  result = b + a
  Answer = f"{var} > {result}, meaning all numbers greater than {result}"
