template: |
  {{name1}} has a parallelogram with base {{base1}} meters and height {{height1}} meters.
  {{name2}} has a parallelogram with base {{base2}} meters and height {{height2}} meters.
  What is the difference in their areas?

solution: |
  area1 = base1 * height1
  area2 = base2 * height2
  difference = abs(area1 - area2)
  Answer = difference
