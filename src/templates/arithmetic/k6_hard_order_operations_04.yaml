template: |
  Insert parentheses to make this equation true: {{a}} + {{b}} × {{c}} − {{d}} = {% set target = (a + b) * (c - d) %}{{target}}
  
  Show where the parentheses should go.

solution: |
  # Calculate the target: (a + b) × (c − d)
  target = (a + b) * (c - d)
  
  # The answer is showing where parentheses go
  Answer = f"({a} + {b}) × ({c} − {d}) = {target}"
