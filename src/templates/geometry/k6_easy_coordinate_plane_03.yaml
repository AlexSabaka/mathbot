template: |
  {{name}} is learning about the coordinate plane.
  
  If a point is at ({{x1}}, {{y1}}), in which quadrant is it located?

solution: |
  if x1 == 0 or y1 == 0:
      if x1 == 0 and y1 == 0:
          Answer = "origin"
      elif x1 == 0:
          Answer = "y-axis"
      else:
          Answer = "x-axis"
  elif x1 > 0 and y1 > 0:
      Answer = "Quadrant I"
  elif x1 < 0 and y1 > 0:
      Answer = "Quadrant II"
  elif x1 < 0 and y1 < 0:
      Answer = "Quadrant III"
  else:
      Answer = "Quadrant IV"
