template: |
  {{name_a}} has a rectangle that is {{length_a}} units by {{width_a}} units.
  {{name_b}} has a rectangle that is {{length_b}} units by {{width_b}} units.
  
  Whose rectangle has a larger area?
  
  Please solve this problem.

solution: |
  # Calculate both areas and compare
  area_a = length_a * width_a
  area_b = length_b * width_b
  if area_a > area_b:
      Answer = name_a
  elif area_b > area_a:
      Answer = name_b
  else:
      Answer = "same area"
