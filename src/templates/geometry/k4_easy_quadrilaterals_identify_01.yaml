variables:
  property_1:
    type: string
    choices: [4 equal sides, 4 right angles, opposite sides parallel, opposite sides equal]
  property_2:
    type: string
    choices: [4 equal sides, 4 right angles, opposite sides parallel, opposite sides equal]
  Answer:
    type: string

template: |
  A quadrilateral has {{property_1}} and {{property_2}}.
  What type of quadrilateral is it?

solution: |
  # Determine shape based on properties
  props = sorted([property_1, property_2])

  # Square has all properties
  if '4 equal sides' in props and '4 right angles' in props:
      Answer = "square"
  # Rectangle has right angles and parallel sides
  elif '4 right angles' in props and 'opposite sides parallel' in props:
      Answer = "rectangle"
  # Rhombus has equal sides and parallel sides
  elif '4 equal sides' in props and 'opposite sides parallel' in props:
      Answer = "rhombus"
  # Generic cases
  elif '4 equal sides' in props and 'opposite sides equal' in props:
      Answer = "rhombus"
  elif '4 right angles' in props and 'opposite sides equal' in props:
      Answer = "rectangle"
  elif 'opposite sides parallel' in props and 'opposite sides equal' in props:
      Answer = "parallelogram"
  else:
      Answer = "quadrilateral"
