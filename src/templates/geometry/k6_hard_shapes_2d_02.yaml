  {{name}} claims that all rhombuses are parallelograms, but not all parallelograms are rhombuses.
  
  Is {{name}}'s statement true or false? Explain why.

solution: |
  Answer = "True. All rhombuses have two pairs of parallel sides, making them parallelograms. However, parallelograms don't necessarily have all sides equal in length, which is required for a rhombus."
