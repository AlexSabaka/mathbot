template: |
  {{name1}} works at a rate of {{rate1}} items per hour. {{name2}} works at a rate of {{rate2}} items per hour. If they both work for {{time}} hours, how many more items does the faster worker complete?

solution: |
  total1 = rate1 * time
  total2 = rate2 * time
  Answer = round(abs(total1 - total2), 2)
