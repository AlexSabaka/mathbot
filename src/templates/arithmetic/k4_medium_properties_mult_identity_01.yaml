template: |
  {{name}} says any number multiplied by {{value}} equals {% if value == 0 %}zero{% else %}the number itself{% endif %}.
  Is {{name}} correct? Give three examples to support your answer.

solution: |
  # Generate three random examples
  example1 = 5
  example2 = 12
  example3 = 25

  if value == 0:
      result1 = example1 * 0
      result2 = example2 * 0
      result3 = example3 * 0
      property_name = "Zero Property"
      Answer = f"Yes, {name} is correct. Examples: {example1} × 0 = {result1}, {example2} × 0 = {result2}, {example3} × 0 = {result3}. This is the {property_name} of Multiplication."
  else:  # value == 1
      result1 = example1 * 1
      result2 = example2 * 1
      result3 = example3 * 1
      property_name = "Identity Property"
      Answer = f"Yes, {name} is correct. Examples: {example1} × 1 = {result1}, {example2} × 1 = {result2}, {example3} × 1 = {result3}. This is the {property_name} of Multiplication."

    expected:
      answer: "Yes, James is correct. Examples: 5 × 0 = 0, 12 × 0 = 0, 25 × 0 = 0. This is the Zero Property of Multiplication."
