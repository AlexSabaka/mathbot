template: |
  A population of rabbits doubles every year. Starting with {{initial_population}} rabbits, write an exponential expression for the population after {{years}} years and calculate the result.

solution: |
  # Expression: initial * 2^years
  expression = f"{initial_population} × 2^{years}"
  
  # Calculate result
  result = initial_population * (2 ** years)
  
  Answer = f"{expression} | {result}"
