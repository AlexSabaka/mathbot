  A map has a scale of {{a}} inch = {{b}} miles. If two cities are {{c}} inches apart on the map, what is the actual distance between them? If the actual distance between two other cities is {{d}} miles, how far apart are they on the map?

solution: |
  # First question: c inches on map = ? miles actual
  actual_distance = (c * b) / a
  
  # Second question: d miles actual = ? inches on map
  map_distance = (d * a) / b
  
  Answer1 = round(actual_distance, 2)
  Answer2 = round(map_distance, 2)
