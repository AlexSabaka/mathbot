template: |
  {{name}} begins a road trip from {{city1}} to {{city2}}. Starting at {{initial_speed}}, they gradually accelerate at a constant rate of {{acceleration}} per hour over the next {{time}} hours. What is their final speed, and how far did they travel during this time?

solution: |
  # Final speed: v = v0 + at
  final_speed = initial_speed + (acceleration * time)
  
  # Distance with constant acceleration: d = v0*t + 0.5*a*t^2
  distance = (initial_speed * time) + (0.5 * acceleration * time * time)
  
  Answer1 = round(final_speed, 2)
  Answer2 = round(distance, 2)
