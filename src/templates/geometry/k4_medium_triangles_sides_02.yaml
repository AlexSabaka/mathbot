  equal_side:
    type: integer
    min: 3

  third_side:

  Answer:
    type: integer

template: |
  {{name}} draws a triangle with two sides of {{equal_side}} cm each.
  The third side is {{third_side}} cm.
  What is the perimeter?

solution: |
  # Check triangle inequality: a + a > b and a + b > a
  if equal_side + equal_side > third_side and equal_side + third_side > equal_side:
      # Valid triangle, calculate perimeter
      Answer = equal_side + equal_side + third_side
  else:
      # Invalid triangle (shouldn't happen with proper constraints)
      Answer = equal_side + equal_side + third_side
