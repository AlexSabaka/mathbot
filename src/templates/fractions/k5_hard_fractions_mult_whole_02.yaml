template: |
  {{name}} and {{friends}} friends each walk {{numerator}}/{{denominator}} of a mile to school each day.
  How far does the entire group walk together in {{days}} days?

solution: |
  # Total people in the group
  total_people = friends + 1
  
  # Distance per day for the group
  distance_per_day_numerator = total_people * numerator
  
  # Total distance for all days
  total_numerator = distance_per_day_numerator * days
  
  # Simplify the fraction
  common = math.gcd(total_numerator, denominator)
  final_num = total_numerator // common
  final_den = denominator // common
  
  Answer = (final_num, final_den)
