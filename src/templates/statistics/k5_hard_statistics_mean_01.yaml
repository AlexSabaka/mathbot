  Answer:
    type: integer

template: |
  The mean of {{count}} numbers is {{mean_value}}.
  If 4 of the numbers are {{num1}}, {{num2}}, {{num3}}, and {{num4}}, what is the missing number?

solution: |
  # Calculate total from mean
  total = mean_value * count
  
  # Calculate sum of known numbers
  known_sum = num1 + num2 + num3 + num4
  
  # Find missing number
  Answer = total - known_sum
