template: |
  {{name1}} has {{fraction}} of a pizza. {{name2}} has {{decimal_val}} of a pizza. Convert both to decimals and determine how much pizza they have together.

solution: |
  # Convert fractions to decimals
  frac_to_dec = {
      "3/4": 0.75,
      "2/5": 0.4,
      "5/8": 0.625
  }
  
  frac_val = frac_to_dec[fraction]
  dec_val = float(decimal_val)
  total = frac_val + dec_val
  
  Answer = str(round(total, 3))
