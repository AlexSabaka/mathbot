template: |
  {{name1}} scored {{score1a}}, {{score1b}}, and {{score1c}} on three tests.
  {{name2}} scored {{score2a}}, {{score2b}}, and {{score2c}} on three tests.
  
  What is the difference between their average scores?

solution: |
  # Calculate averages
  avg1 = (score1a + score1b + score1c) // 3
  avg2 = (score2a + score2b + score2c) // 3
  
  # Find difference
  Answer = abs(avg1 - avg2)
