  A figure has point symmetry around the origin (0, 0).
  Point A is at ({{a}}, {{b}}).
  Point B is at ({{c}}, {{d}}).

  a) Where is the point symmetric to A?
  b) Where is the point symmetric to B?
  c) If the figure is a quadrilateral with vertices A, B, A', B', what type of quadrilateral is it?

solution: |
  # Point symmetry about origin: (x, y) -> (-x, -y)
  a_prime_x = -a
  a_prime_y = -b
  Answer1 = f"({a_prime_x}, {a_prime_y})"

  b_prime_x = -c
  b_prime_y = -d
  Answer2 = f"({b_prime_x}, {b_prime_y})"

  # A quadrilateral with point symmetry is a parallelogram
