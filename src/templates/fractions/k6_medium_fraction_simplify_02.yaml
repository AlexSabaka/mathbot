  Simplify both fractions: {{a1}}/{{b1}} and {{a2}}/{{b2}}. Are they equivalent?

solution: |
  from math import gcd
  
  # Simplify first fraction
  common1 = gcd(a1, b1)
  simp1_num = a1 // common1
  simp1_den = b1 // common1
  
  # Simplify second fraction
  common2 = gcd(a2, b2)
  simp2_num = a2 // common2
  simp2_den = b2 // common2
  
  # Check if equivalent
  if simp1_num == simp2_num and simp1_den == simp2_den:
    Answer = f"{simp1_num}/{simp1_den} and {simp2_num}/{simp2_den} | Yes, they are equivalent"
  else:
    Answer = f"{simp1_num}/{simp1_den} and {simp2_num}/{simp2_den} | No, they are not equivalent"
