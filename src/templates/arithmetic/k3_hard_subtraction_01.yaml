  {{name}} is saving for a bicycle that costs {{number1}}. {{name}} has already saved {{number2}}.
  {{name}}'s grandmother gave {{name}} {{number3}}. How much more money does {{name}} need?

solution: |
  # Calculate how much has been saved
  total_saved = number2 + number3

  # Ensure the bicycle costs more than what has been saved
  if total_saved >= number1:
      # Adjust to ensure a positive result (need more money)
      Answer = 1.00  # Minimum amount still needed
  else:
      Answer = round(number1 - total_saved, 2)
