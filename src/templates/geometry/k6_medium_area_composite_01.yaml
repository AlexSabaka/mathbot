template: |
  A rectangular yard measures {{yard_length}} ft by {{yard_width}} ft. A square patio measuring {{patio_side}} ft by {{patio_side}} ft is built in one corner.
  
  What is the area of the yard NOT covered by the patio?

solution: |
  # Total yard area
  yard_area = yard_length * yard_width
  # Patio area
  patio_area = patio_side * patio_side
  # Remaining area
  remaining = yard_area - patio_area
  Answer = remaining
