template: |
  {{name}} uses {{fraction1}} of a cup of {{item}} for one recipe and {{fraction2}} of a cup for another recipe. Convert both fractions to decimals and find the total amount of {{item}} used in decimal form.

solution: |
  # Convert fractions to decimals
  frac_to_dec = {
      "1/2": 0.5,
      "3/4": 0.75,
      "2/3": 0.667,
      "1/4": 0.25,
      "1/3": 0.333,
      "1/5": 0.2
  }
  
  val1 = frac_to_dec[fraction1]
  val2 = frac_to_dec[fraction2]
  total = val1 + val2
  
  Answer = str(round(total, 3))
