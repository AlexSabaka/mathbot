template: |
  {{name}} needs to fill a rectangular pool that is {{length}} feet × {{width}} feet × {{height}} feet with water.
  Water costs ${{cost_per_cubic}} per cubic foot.
  What is the volume of the pool, and what is the total cost to fill it?

solution: |
  # Calculate volume
  volume = length * width * height
  
  # Calculate cost
  total_cost = volume * cost_per_cubic
  
  Answer1 = volume
  Answer2 = round(total_cost, 2)
