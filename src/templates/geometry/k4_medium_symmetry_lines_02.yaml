  # Multiple valid answers exist for each case
  if num_lines == 1:
      Answer = "kite, isosceles triangle, or heart shape"
  elif num_lines == 2:
      Answer = "rectangle or rhombus"
  elif num_lines == 3:
      Answer = "equilateral triangle"
  elif num_lines == 4:
      Answer = "square"
  else:
      Answer = "regular polygon"
