  {{name}} has {{a}}/{{b}} of a cake. If {{name}} divides it into pieces that are {{c}}/{{d}} of the whole cake each, how many pieces will there be?

solution: |
  from math import gcd
  
  # Division: (a/b) ÷ (c/d) = (a*d)/(b*c)
  numerator = a * d
  denominator = b * c
  
  # Simplify
  common = gcd(numerator, denominator)
  Answer = (numerator // common, denominator // common)
