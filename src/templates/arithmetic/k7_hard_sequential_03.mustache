person1_total = {{price1}} + {{price2}} + {{price3}}
person2_total = {{price4}} + {{price5}}
subtotal = person1_total + person2_total
discount_amount = subtotal * ({{coupon}} / 100)
after_discount = subtotal - discount_amount
tax_amount = after_discount * ({{tax}} / 100)
Answer = after_discount + tax_amount
