  name2:
    type: person
  a:
    type: integer
    min: 50

  Answer:
    type: string

template: |
  {{name1}} has {{a}} {{item}}. {{name2}} has {{b}} {{item}}.
  {{name1}} says: "Together we have {{a}} + {{b}} {{item}}."
  {{name2}} says: "Together we have {{b}} + {{a}} {{item}}."
  Who is correct? Use the commutative property to explain your answer.

solution: |
  # Calculate both expressions
  sum1 = a + b
  sum2 = b + a

  # Both are correct due to commutative property
  Answer = f"Both are correct. The commutative property of addition states that the order of addends does not change the sum. {a} + {b} = {sum1} and {b} + {a} = {sum2}, so they have {sum1} {item} together."

      answer: "Both are correct. The commutative property of addition states that the order of addends does not change the sum. 124 + 167 = 291 and 167 + 124 = 291, so they have 291 pencils together."
