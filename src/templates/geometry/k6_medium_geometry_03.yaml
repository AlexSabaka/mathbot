template: |
  {% if is_square %}A homeowner plans to fence their square garden, which has sides measuring {{side}}m each.{% else %}A homeowner wants to install fencing around their rectangular garden measuring {{length}}m by {{width}}m.{% endif %}
  
  The fencing material costs {{cost_per_meter}} per meter.
  
  {% if has_gate %}However, there's already a {{gate_width}}m-wide gate installed, so no fencing is needed for that section. {% endif %}
  
  What is the total cost of the fencing project?
  
  Please solve this problem and provide your final answer.

solution: |
  if is_square:
      perimeter = 4 * side
  else:
      perimeter = 2 * (length + width)
  
  if has_gate:
      fencing_needed = perimeter - gate_width
  else:
      fencing_needed = perimeter
  
  total_cost = fencing_needed * cost_per_meter
  Answer = round(total_cost, 2)
