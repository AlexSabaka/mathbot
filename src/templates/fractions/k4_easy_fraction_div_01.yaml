template: |
  {{name}} has {{numerator}}/{{denominator}} of a [pizza|cake|pie] to share equally among {{divisor}} people.
  What fraction does each person get?

solution: |
  from math import gcd

  # Divide fraction by whole number: multiply denominator by the whole number
  # Or equivalently: multiply by 1/divisor
  result_numerator = numerator
  result_denominator = denominator * divisor

  # Simplify
  common_divisor = gcd(result_numerator, result_denominator)
  final_numerator = result_numerator // common_divisor
  final_denominator = result_denominator // common_divisor

  Answer = (final_numerator, final_denominator)
