template: |
  {{name}} drew two rectangles side by side. The first rectangle is {{length_a}} units by {{width_a}} units. The second rectangle is {{length_b}} units by {{width_b}} units.
  
  What is the total area of both rectangles?
  
  Please solve this problem.

solution: |
  # Calculate each area and add them
  area_a = length_a * width_a
  area_b = length_b * width_b
  Answer = area_a + area_b
