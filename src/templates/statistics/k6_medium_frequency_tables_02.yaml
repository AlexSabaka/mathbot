template: |
  Based on this frequency table, calculate the mean: {{val1}} (frequency: {{freq1}}), {{val2}} (frequency: {{freq2}}), {{val3}} (frequency: {{freq3}}), {{val4}} (frequency: {{freq4}}).
  
  Please solve this problem.

solution: |
  total = val1 * freq1 + val2 * freq2 + val3 * freq3 + val4 * freq4
  count = freq1 + freq2 + freq3 + freq4
  Answer = total // count
