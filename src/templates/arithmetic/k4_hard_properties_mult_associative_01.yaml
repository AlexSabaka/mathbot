  A warehouse has {{a}} sections. Each section has {{b}} shelves.
  Each shelf holds {{c}} boxes.
  Use the associative property to calculate the total boxes in two different ways.

solution: |
  # Method 1: (a × b) × c - multiply sections by shelves first
  method1_inner = a * b
  method1_total = method1_inner * c

  # Method 2: a × (b × c) - multiply shelves by boxes first
  method2_inner = b * c
  method2_total = a * method2_inner

  Answer = f"Method 1: ({a} × {b}) × {c}. First find total shelves: {a} × {b} = {method1_inner} shelves. Then multiply by boxes per shelf: {method1_inner} × {c} = {method1_total} boxes. Method 2: {a} × ({b} × {c}). First find boxes per section: {b} × {c} = {method2_inner} boxes. Then multiply by sections: {a} × {method2_inner} = {method2_total} boxes. Both methods give {method1_total} boxes total."

      answer: "Method 1: (3 × 5) × 8. First find total shelves: 3 × 5 = 15 shelves. Then multiply by boxes per shelf: 15 × 8 = 120 boxes. Method 2: 3 × (5 × 8). First find boxes per section: 5 × 8 = 40 boxes. Then multiply by sections: 3 × 40 = 120 boxes. Both methods give 120 boxes total."
