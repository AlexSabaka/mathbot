  Answer:
    type: string

template: |
  {{name}} starts at point ({{x1}}, {{y1}}).
  
  {{name}} moves {{horizontal_dist}} units to the left and {{vertical_dist}} units down. What are the new coordinates?

solution: |
  new_x = x1 - horizontal_dist
  new_y = y1 - vertical_dist
  Answer = f"({new_x}, {new_y})"
