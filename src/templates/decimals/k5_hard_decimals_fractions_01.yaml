template: |
  A carpenter needs a board that is {{whole}} {{numerator}}/{{denominator}} feet long. What decimal length should the carpenter look for? If the closest available size is {{decimal_available}} feet, is it long enough?

solution: |
  # Convert mixed number to decimal
  # Simply divide numerator by denominator
  needed_length = whole + (numerator / denominator)
  
  if decimal_available >= needed_length:
      Answer = f"{round(needed_length, 3)} feet | Yes, {decimal_available} feet is long enough"
  else:
      Answer = f"{round(needed_length, 3)} feet | No, {decimal_available} feet is too short"
