  Answer:
    type: string

template: |
  Show that {{a}} × {{b}} = {{b}} × {{a}}

solution: |
  # Calculate both products
  product1 = a * b
  product2 = b * a

  # Show both calculations
  Answer = f"{a} × {b} = {product1} and {b} × {a} = {product2}. Both equal {product1}, showing the commutative property."
