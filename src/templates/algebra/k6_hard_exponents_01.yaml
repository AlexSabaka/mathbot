  Answer:
    type: string

template: |
  A bacteria colony doubles every hour. If there are {{initial_bacteria}} bacteria at the start, write an expression using exponents for the number of bacteria after {{hours}} hours. Then calculate the result.

solution: |
  # Expression: initial * 2^hours
  expression = f"{initial_bacteria} × 2^{hours}"
  
  # Calculate result
  result = initial_bacteria * (2 ** hours)
  
  Answer = f"{expression} | {result}"
