template: |
  {{name}} has two ropes measuring {{a}} inches and {{b}} inches. {{name}} wants to cut both ropes into pieces of equal length with no leftover rope.
  
  What are all the possible lengths {{name}} could cut the pieces?

solution: |
  # Find all factors of a
  factors_a = []
  for i in range(1, a + 1):
    if a % i == 0:
      factors_a.append(i)
  
  # Find all factors of b
  factors_b = []
  for i in range(1, b + 1):
    if b % i == 0:
      factors_b.append(i)
  
  # Find common factors
  common = []
  for f in factors_a:
    if f in factors_b and f not in common:
      common.append(f)
  
  # Sort and format as comma-separated string
  common = sorted(common)
  Answer = ", ".join(str(f) for f in common)
