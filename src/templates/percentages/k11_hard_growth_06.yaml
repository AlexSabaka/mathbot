  Answer1:
    type: decimal

template: |
  {{name}} invests {{principal}} in an account earning {{rate}}% annual interest, compounded yearly. They want to know how long it will take for their investment to reach {{target_amount}}. Using the formula t = log(A/P) / log(1 + r), where A is the target amount, P is the principal, and r is the rate (as a decimal), how many years will it take?

solution: |
  if target_amount <= principal:
      years_needed = 0.0
  else:
      r = rate / 100
      years_needed = math.log(target_amount / principal) / math.log(1 + r)
  Answer1 = round(years_needed, 2)
  Answer2 = "years"
