variables:
  number1:
    type: integer
    min: 2
    max: 9
  number2:
    type: integer
    min: 11
    max: 19
  Answer:
    type: integer

template: |
  Use the area model to find {{number1}} × {{number2}}.
  Break {{number2}} into 10 + {{number2 - 10}} and show your work.

solution: |
  # Break number2 into tens and ones
  tens = 10
  ones = number2 - 10

  # Multiply by tens part
  tens_product = number1 * tens

  # Multiply by ones part
  ones_product = number1 * ones

  # Add the two products
  Answer = tens_product + ones_product
