variables:
  var:
    type: string
    choices: [x, n]
  a:
    type: integer
    min: 2
    max: 6
  b:
    type: integer
    min: 12
    max: 48
  Answer:
    type: string

template: |
  Solve and graph: {{a}}{{var}} < {{b}}
  
  Describe the solution.

solution: |
  # Divide both sides by a
  result = b // a
  Answer = f"{var} < {result}, meaning all numbers less than {result}"
