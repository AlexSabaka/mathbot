template: |
  {{name}} scored {{fraction}} on the first test and {{decimal_val}} on the second test. Convert the fraction to a decimal and determine which score was higher.

solution: |
  # Convert fractions to decimals
  frac_to_dec = {
      "4/5": 0.8,
      "3/4": 0.75,
      "2/3": 0.67
  }
  
  frac_val = frac_to_dec[fraction]
  dec_val = float(decimal_val)
  
  if frac_val > dec_val:
      Answer = f"First test ({fraction} = {frac_val})"
  elif dec_val > frac_val:
      Answer = f"Second test ({decimal_val})"
  else:
      Answer = "Both scores are equal"
