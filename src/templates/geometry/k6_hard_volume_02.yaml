template: |
  {{name}} has a rectangular pool that is {{pool_l}} feet long, {{pool_w}} feet wide, and {{pool_h}} feet deep. {{name}} fills the pool to {{fill_fraction}} of its depth.
  
  How many cubic feet of water are in the pool?

solution: |
  # Parse fraction
  fractions = {"3/4": 0.75, "2/3": 2/3, "4/5": 0.8}
  fraction_value = fractions.get(fill_fraction, 0.75)
  
  # Total volume
  total = pool_l * pool_w * pool_h
  # Filled volume
  filled = total * fraction_value
  Answer = int(filled)
