template: |
  {{name1}} has a triangular garden with a base of {{base1}} meters and height of {{height1}} meters.
  {{name2}} has a triangular garden with a base of {{base2}} meters and height of {{height2}} meters.
  How much larger is the bigger garden?

solution: |
  area1 = (base1 * height1) / 2
  area2 = (base2 * height2) / 2
  difference = int(abs(area1 - area2))
  Answer = difference
