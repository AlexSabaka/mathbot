  Answer:
    type: integer
    format: volume

template: |
  {{name}} has two boxes.
  Box A is {{l1}} cm × {{w1}} cm × {{h1}} cm.
  Box B is {{l2}} cm × {{w2}} cm × {{h2}} cm.
  How much more volume does the larger box have?

solution: |
  volume_a = l1 * w1 * h1
  volume_b = l2 * w2 * h2
  difference = abs(volume_a - volume_b)
  Answer = difference
