  A rectangle has a length that is {{a}} times its width. If the perimeter is {{perimeter}} units, what are the length and width?

solution: |
  # Let w = width, then length = a*w
  # Perimeter = 2*(length + width) = 2*(a*w + w) = 2*w*(a+1)
  # 2*w*(a+1) = perimeter
  # w = perimeter / (2*(a+1))
  width = perimeter // (2 * (a + 1))
  length = a * width
  
  Answer1 = length
  Answer2 = width
