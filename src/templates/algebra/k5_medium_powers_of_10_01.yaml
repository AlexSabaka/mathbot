    type: string

template: |
  Express {{large_number}} as a product of a single digit and a power of 10.

solution: |
  # Find the single digit and power
  digit = large_number // 10000
  if large_number == digit * 10000:
      Answer = f"{digit} × 10^4"
  else:
      # Adjust for cases where it's not exactly divisible
      temp = large_number
      power = 0
      while temp >= 10:
          temp = temp / 10
          power += 1
      Answer = f"{int(temp)} × 10^{power}"
