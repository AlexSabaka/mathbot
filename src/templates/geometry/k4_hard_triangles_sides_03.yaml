  Answer:
    type: integer

template: |
  An isosceles triangle has a perimeter of {{perimeter}} cm.
  The two equal sides are each {{equal_side}} cm long.
  What is the length of the third side?

solution: |
  # Calculate third side
  third_side = perimeter - 2 * equal_side

  # Verify triangle inequality
  # For an isosceles triangle: a + a > b becomes 2a > b
  # Also need: a + b > a which is always true if b > 0
  if third_side > 0 and 2 * equal_side > third_side:
      Answer = third_side
  else:
      # Invalid triangle (shouldn't happen with proper constraints)
      Answer = third_side
