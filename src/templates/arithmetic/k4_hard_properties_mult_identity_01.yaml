    type: person
  item:
    type: item
    category: grocery
  a:
    type: integer

  Answer:
    type: string

template: |
  {{name}} is organizing items in a store.
  There are {{a}} boxes, and each box contains {{b}} {{item}}.
  How many {{item}} are there in total?
  What multiplication property does this demonstrate?

solution: |
  # Calculate total items
  total = a * b

  if b == 0:
      property_name = "Zero Property"
      explanation = f"even though there are {a} boxes"
  else:  # b == 1
      property_name = "Identity Property"
      explanation = f"since each box contains exactly 1 item"

  Answer = f"Total: {a} × {b} = {total} {item}. This demonstrates the {property_name} of Multiplication because {explanation}."

tests:
  - seed: 12345
    expected:
      answer: "Total: 67 × 1 = 67 apples. This demonstrates the Identity Property of Multiplication because since each box contains exactly 1 item."

  - seed: 67890
    expected:
      answer: "Total: 78 × 0 = 0 bread. This demonstrates the Zero Property of Multiplication because even though there are 78 boxes."
