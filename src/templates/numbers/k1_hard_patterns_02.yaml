variables:
  start:
    type: integer
    min: 1

    min: 1
    max: 3
  Answer1:
    type: integer
  Answer2:
    type: integer

template: |
  Look at this growing pattern: {{start}}, {{start + increment}}, {{start + 2*increment}}, {{start + 3*increment}}
  
  What number comes next? And after that?

solution: |
  Answer1 = start + 4 * increment
  Answer2 = start + 5 * increment
