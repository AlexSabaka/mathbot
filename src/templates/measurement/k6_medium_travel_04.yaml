  Answer:
    type: time

template: |
  {{name}} works as a delivery driver for {{company}} in {{city}}. They have three stops to make.
  
  The first stop is {{distance1}} miles away at {{speed1}} mph, taking {{delivery1}} minutes for delivery.
  
  The second stop is {{distance2}} miles away at {{speed2}} mph, taking {{delivery2}} minutes for delivery.
  
  The third stop is {{distance3}} miles away at {{speed3}} mph, taking {{delivery3}} minutes for delivery.
  
  How long does the entire delivery route take?

solution: |
  travel_time1 = distance1 / speed1
  delivery_time1 = delivery1 / 60
  travel_time2 = distance2 / speed2
  delivery_time2 = delivery2 / 60
  travel_time3 = distance3 / speed3
  delivery_time3 = delivery3 / 60
  total_time = travel_time1 + delivery_time1 + travel_time2 + delivery_time2 + travel_time3 + delivery_time3
  Answer = round(total_time, 2)
