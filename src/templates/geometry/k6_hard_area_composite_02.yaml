template: |
  {{name}} has a rectangular piece of wood measuring {{outer_length}} inches by {{outer_width}} inches. {{name}} cuts out a circular hole with a diameter of {{circle_diameter}} inches.
  
  What is the remaining area of the wood? (Use π ≈ 3.14)

solution: |
  # Rectangle area
  rect_area = outer_length * outer_width
  # Circle area: π × r²
  radius = circle_diameter / 2
  circle_area = 3.14 * radius * radius
  # Remaining area
  remaining = rect_area - circle_area
  Answer = round(remaining, 2)
