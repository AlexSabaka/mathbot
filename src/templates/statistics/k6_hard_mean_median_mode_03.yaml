template: |
  The first four test scores for {{name}} are {{score1}}, {{score2}}, {{score3}}, and {{score4}}. What score must {{name}} get on the fifth test to achieve a mean of exactly {{target_mean}}?
  
  Please solve this problem.

solution: |
  total_current = score1 + score2 + score3 + score4
  total_needed = target_mean * 5
  Answer = total_needed - total_current
