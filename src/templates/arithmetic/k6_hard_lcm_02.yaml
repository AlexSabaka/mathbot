  {{name1}} visits the gym every {{a}} days, {{name2}} visits every {{b}} days, and {{name3}} visits every {{c}} days. If they all visit today, in how many days will all three visit on the same day again?

solution: |
  # Find LCM of three numbers
  lcm_ab = abs(a * b) // math.gcd(a, b)
  lcm_abc = abs(lcm_ab * c) // math.gcd(lcm_ab, c)
  
  Answer = lcm_abc
