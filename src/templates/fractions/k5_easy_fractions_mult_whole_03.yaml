variables:
  whole_number:
    type: integer
    min: 4
    max: 8
  numerator:
    type: integer
    min: 2
    max: 6
  denominator:

  Answer:
    type: fraction

template: |
  Multiply {{whole_number}} by {{numerator}}/{{denominator}}.

solution: |
  # Multiply whole number by numerator
  result_numerator = whole_number * numerator
  
  # Simplify the fraction
  common = math.gcd(result_numerator, denominator)
  final_num = result_numerator // common
  final_den = denominator // common
  
  Answer = (final_num, final_den)
