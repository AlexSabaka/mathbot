template: |
  {{name}} needs to score at least {{a}} points to win a prize. {{name}} currently has {{b}} points. Write and solve an inequality to find how many more points {{name}} needs. Graph the solution.

solution: |
  # Let x = additional points needed
  # b + x ≥ a
  # x ≥ a - b
  needed = a - b
  Answer = f"{name} needs at least {needed} more points. Solution: x ≥ {needed}, graphed as all numbers greater than or equal to {needed}"
