template: |
  A composite shape consists of a rectangle measuring {{rect_l}} m by {{rect_w}} m with a triangle attached to one side. The triangle has a base of {{tri_base}} m and a height of {{tri_height}} m.
  
  What is the total area of the composite shape?

solution: |
  # Rectangle area
  rect_area = rect_l * rect_w
  # Triangle area
  tri_area = (tri_base * tri_height) / 2
  # Total area
  total = rect_area + tri_area
  Answer = int(total)
