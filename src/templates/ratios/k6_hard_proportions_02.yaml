template: |
  {{name}} can lay {{bricks1}} bricks in {{time1}} hours. How long will it take to lay {{bricks2}} bricks? If {{name}} works for {{hours_available}} hours, how many bricks can be laid?

solution: |
  # First question: time to lay bricks2
  time_needed = (time1 * bricks2) / bricks1
  
  # Second question: bricks laid in hours_available
  bricks_laid = (bricks1 * hours_available) / time1
  
  Answer1 = round(time_needed, 2)
  Answer2 = round(bricks_laid, 2)
