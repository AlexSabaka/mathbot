template: |
  {{name}} measured a {{object_a}} that is {{length_a_m}} m {{length_a_cm}} cm long.
  {{name}} also measured a {{object_b}} that is {{length_b}} cm long.
  
  What is the total length in centimeters?
  
  Please solve this problem.

solution: |
  # Convert first measurement to cm and add
  length_a_total = (length_a_m * 100) + length_a_cm
  Answer = length_a_total + length_b
