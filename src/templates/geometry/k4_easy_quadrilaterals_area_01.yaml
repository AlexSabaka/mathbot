variables:
  shape_type:
    type: string
    choices: [rectangle, square]
  length:
    type: integer
    min: 5
    max: 15
  width:
    type: integer
    min: 3
    max: 10
  unit:
    type: string
    choices: [cm, m]
  Answer:
    type: integer

template: |
  {% if shape_type == 'square' %}
  A square has a side length of {{length}} {{unit}}.
  What is its area?
  {% else %}
  A rectangle has a length of {{length}} {{unit}} and a width of {{width}} {{unit}}.
  What is its area?
  {% endif %}

solution: |
  if shape_type == 'square':
      # Area of square = side × side
      Answer = length * length
  else:  # rectangle
      # Area of rectangle = length × width
      Answer = length * width
