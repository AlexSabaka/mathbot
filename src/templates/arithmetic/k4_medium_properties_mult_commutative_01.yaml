    type: string

template: |
  A rectangle has {{a}} rows of {{item}} with {{b}} in each row.
  Another rectangle has {{b}} rows with {{a}} in each row.
  Do both rectangles have the same total? Explain using the commutative property.

solution: |
  # Calculate both arrangements
  total1 = a * b
  total2 = b * a

  # Explain the commutative property
  Answer = f"Yes, both rectangles have the same total. The first rectangle has {a} × {b} = {total1} {item}. The second rectangle has {b} × {a} = {total2} {item}. The commutative property of multiplication shows that {a} × {b} = {b} × {a} = {total1}."
