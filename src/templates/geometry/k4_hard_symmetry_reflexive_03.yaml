  A shape is reflected over a line passing through points (0, 0) and ({{a}}, {{a}}).
  Point P at ({{px}}, {{py}}) reflects to point P'.

  Find the coordinates of P'.

  Hint: This line has the equation y = x.

solution: |
  # For reflection over y = x: (x, y) -> (y, x)
  # The diagonal line y = x reflects by swapping coordinates
  p_prime_x = py
  p_prime_y = px
  Answer = f"({p_prime_x}, {p_prime_y})"
