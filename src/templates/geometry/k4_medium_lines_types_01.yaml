  Answer:
    type: string

template: |
  Draw two lines that are {{relationship}}.
  Label them as Line {{line1_letter}} and Line {{line2_letter}}.
  Mark the relationship with the correct symbol.

solution: |
  # For drawing tasks, the answer describes what should be drawn
  if relationship == "parallel":
      Answer = "Two lines that never meet, marked with arrow symbols (>>)"
  else:
      Answer = "Two lines that meet at a 90-degree angle, marked with a right angle symbol (⊥)"
