template: |
  {{name}} goes to {{activity}} every {{event_day}}. If today is {{current_day}}, how many more days until {{name}} goes to {{activity}} again?

solution: |
  days = ['Monday', 'Tuesday', 'Wednesday', 'Thursday', 'Friday', 'Saturday', 'Sunday']
  current_index = days.index(current_day)
  event_index = days.index(event_day)
  
  if event_index > current_index:
      days_until = event_index - current_index
  else:
      days_until = 7 - current_index + event_index
  
  Answer = days_until
