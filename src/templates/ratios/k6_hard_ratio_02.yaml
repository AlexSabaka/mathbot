template: |
  {{name1}} and {{name2}} share ${{total}} in the ratio {{ratio_a}}:{{ratio_b}}. How much money does each person receive?

solution: |
  # Ensure total is divisible by (ratio_a + ratio_b)
  total_parts = ratio_a + ratio_b
  if total % total_parts != 0:
      total = (total // total_parts) * total_parts
  
  amount1 = (ratio_a * total) // total_parts
  amount2 = (ratio_b * total) // total_parts
  
  Answer1 = amount1
  Answer2 = amount2
