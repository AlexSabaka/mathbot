  The ratio of boys to girls in a class is {{a}}:{{b}}. If there are {{n}} students in total, how many boys and how many girls are there?

solution: |
  # Ensure n is divisible by (a + b)
  total_parts = a + b
  if n % total_parts != 0:
      n = (n // total_parts) * total_parts
  
  boys = (a * n) // total_parts
  girls = (b * n) // total_parts
  
  Answer1 = boys
  Answer2 = girls
