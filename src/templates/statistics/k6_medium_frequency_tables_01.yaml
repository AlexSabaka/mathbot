template: |
  A frequency table shows: Value {{val1}} appears {{freq1}} times, value {{val2}} appears {{freq2}} times, value {{val3}} appears {{freq3}} times. What is the mean of this data?
  
  Please solve this problem.

solution: |
  total = val1 * freq1 + val2 * freq2 + val3 * freq3
  count = freq1 + freq2 + freq3
  Answer = total // count
