template: |
  {{name}} ate {{whole}} whole pizzas and {{numerator}}/{{denominator}} of another pizza.
  Write this as a mixed number and as an improper fraction.

solution: |
  # Ensure numerator < denominator for proper mixed number
  if numerator >= denominator:
      numerator = denominator - 1

  # Mixed number representation
  Answer1 = f"{whole} {numerator}/{denominator}"

  # Convert to improper fraction
  improper_numerator = whole * denominator + numerator
  Answer2 = (improper_numerator, denominator)
