template: |
  Given this frequency data: {{val1}} occurs {{freq1}} times, {{val2}} occurs {{freq2}} times, {{val3}} occurs {{freq3}} times. Find the mean.
  
  Please solve this problem.

solution: |
  total = val1 * freq1 + val2 * freq2 + val3 * freq3
  count = freq1 + freq2 + freq3
  Answer = total // count
