template: |
  A {{service}} charges a ${{service_fee}} service fee plus ${{hourly_rate}} per hour of work. If the {{service}} worked for {{variable}} hours, write an expression for the total cost. Identify the coefficient and constant, then calculate the cost for {{specific_hours}} hours.

solution: |
  Answer1 = f"{hourly_rate}{variable} + {service_fee}"
  Answer2 = str(hourly_rate)
  Answer3 = str(service_fee)
  total_cost = (hourly_rate * specific_hours) + service_fee
  Answer4 = round(total_cost, 2)
