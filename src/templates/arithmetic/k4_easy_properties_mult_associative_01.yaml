  Calculate: ({{a}} × {{b}}) × {{c}}
  Then calculate: {{a}} × ({{b}} × {{c}})
  Are the results the same?

solution: |
  # Calculate left side: (a × b) × c
  left_inner = a * b
  left_result = left_inner * c

  # Calculate right side: a × (b × c)
  right_inner = b * c
  right_result = a * right_inner

  # Create the answer
  Answer = f"First calculation: ({a} × {b}) × {c} = {left_inner} × {c} = {left_result}. Second calculation: {a} × ({b} × {c}) = {a} × {right_inner} = {right_result}. Yes, both results are {left_result}."
