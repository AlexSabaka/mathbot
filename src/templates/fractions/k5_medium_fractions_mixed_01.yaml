template: |
  {{name}} has {{whole}} whole pizzas and {{numerator}}/{{denominator}} of another pizza.
  Write this as an improper fraction.

solution: |
  # Ensure numerator < denominator
  if numerator >= denominator:
      numerator = denominator - 1
  
  # Convert mixed number to improper fraction
  improper_numerator = whole * denominator + numerator
  
  # Simplify if possible
  common = math.gcd(improper_numerator, denominator)
  final_num = improper_numerator // common
  final_den = denominator // common
  
  Answer = (final_num, final_den)
