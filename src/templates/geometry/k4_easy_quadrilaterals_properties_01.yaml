variables:
  shape_type:
    type: string
    choices: [rectangle, square, rhombus]
  side_length:
    type: integer
    min: 3
    max: 15
  width:
    type: integer
    min: 3
    max: 12
  unit:
    type: string
    choices: [cm, m, inches]
  Answer:
    type: integer

template: |
  {% if shape_type == 'square' %}
  A square has a side length of {{side_length}} {{unit}}.
  What is its perimeter?
  {% elif shape_type == 'rhombus' %}
  A rhombus has a side length of {{side_length}} {{unit}}.
  What is its perimeter?
  {% else %}
  A rectangle has a length of {{side_length}} {{unit}} and a width of {{width}} {{unit}}.
  What is its perimeter?
  {% endif %}

solution: |
  if shape_type == 'square':
      # Perimeter of square = 4 × side
      Answer = 4 * side_length
  elif shape_type == 'rhombus':
      # Perimeter of rhombus = 4 × side (all sides equal)
      Answer = 4 * side_length
  else:  # rectangle
      # Perimeter of rectangle = 2(length + width)
      Answer = 2 * (side_length + width)
