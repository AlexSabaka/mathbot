variables:
  angle1:
    type: integer
    min: 20
    max: 60
  angle2:
    type: integer
    min: 30
    max: 70
  Answer:
    type: integer

template: |
  Three angles meet at a point on a straight line.
  The first angle is {{angle1}} degrees.
  The second angle is {{angle2}} degrees.
  What is the third angle?

solution: |
  # Ensure the problem is valid (sum of first two angles < 180)
  if angle1 + angle2 >= 180:
      # This shouldn't happen based on our constraints
      Answer = 0
  else:
      Answer = 180 - angle1 - angle2
