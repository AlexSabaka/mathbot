template: |
  {{name}} drew a polygon where all sides are equal and all angles are equal.
  If each interior angle measures {{angle}}°, how many sides does the polygon have, and what is it called?

solution: |
  # Formula: interior angle = (n-2) × 180 / n
  # Solving: n × angle = (n-2) × 180
  # n × angle = 180n - 360
  # 360 = 180n - n × angle
  # 360 = n(180 - angle)
  # n = 360 / (180 - angle)
  
  num_sides = 360 // (180 - angle)
  
  names = {
    3: "equilateral triangle",
    4: "square",
    5: "regular pentagon",
    6: "regular hexagon"
  }
  
  Answer1 = num_sides
  Answer2 = names[num_sides]
