template: |
  In a class of {{n}} students, {{a}} students have brown hair, {{b}} students have black hair, and the rest have other hair colors. What percentage of students have each hair color?

solution: |
  import math
  
  # Ensure a + b < n
  if a + b >= n:
      a = math.floor(n * 0.3)
      b = math.floor(n * 0.3)
  
  brown_percent = (a / n) * 100
  black_percent = (b / n) * 100
  other = n - a - b
  other_percent = (other / n) * 100
  
  Answer1 = round(brown_percent, 2)
  Answer2 = round(black_percent, 2)
  Answer3 = round(other_percent, 2)
