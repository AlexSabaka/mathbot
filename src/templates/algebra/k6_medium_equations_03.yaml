variables:
  var:
    type: string
    choices: [x, y, n]
  a:
    type: integer
    min: 2
    max: 6
  b:

  Answer:
    type: integer

template: |
  Solve for {{var}}: {{var}}/{{a}} + {{b}} = {{result}}

solution: |
  # Subtract b from both sides: var/a = result - b
  # Multiply by a: var = a * (result - b)
  Answer = a * (result - b)
