template: |
  {{name}} knows that {{a}} × {{b}} = {{a * b}}.
  Use this fact to quickly calculate:
  a) {{a}} × {{b + 1}} = _____
  b) {{a}} × {{b - 1}} = _____
  c) {{a * 2}} × {{b}} = _____

solution: |
  # a) a × (b+1) = a × b + a
  Answer1 = a * (b + 1)

  # b) a × (b-1) = a × b - a
  Answer2 = a * (b - 1)

  # c) (a×2) × b = 2 × (a × b)
  Answer3 = (a * 2) * b
