template: |
  {{name}} starts a {{service}} with an initial cost of ${{initial_cost}} for supplies. {% if name[-1] == 's' %}{{name}}'{% else %}{{name}}'s{% endif %} service charges ${{customer_fee}} per customer. Write an expression for the total profit after {{variable}} customers (remembering to subtract the initial cost), then calculate the profit for {{num_customers}} customers.

solution: |
  Answer1 = f"{customer_fee}{variable} - {initial_cost}"
  profit = (customer_fee * num_customers) - initial_cost
  Answer2 = round(profit, 2)
