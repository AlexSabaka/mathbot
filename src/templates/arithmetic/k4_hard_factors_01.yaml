variables:
  # Generate two numbers that share common factors
  a:
    type: integer
    min: 12
    max: 48
  b:
    type: integer
    min: 12
    max: 48
  Answer:
    type: string

template: |
  Find all the common factors of {{a}} and {{b}}.
  What is the greatest common factor (GCF)?

solution: |
  # Find factors of a
  factors_a = []
  for i in range(1, a + 1):
    if a % i == 0:
      factors_a.append(i)

  # Find factors of b
  factors_b = []
  for i in range(1, b + 1):
    if b % i == 0:
      factors_b.append(i)

  # Find common factors
  common_factors = []
  for f in factors_a:
    if f in factors_b:
      common_factors.append(f)

  # GCF is the largest common factor
  gcf = max(common_factors)

  # Format answer
  common_str = ", ".join(str(f) for f in common_factors)
  Answer = f"Common factors: {common_str}; GCF: {gcf}"
