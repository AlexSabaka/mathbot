  Answer:
    type: integer

template: |
  {{name}} drew a regular {{shape_name}} with a perimeter of {{perimeter}} cm.
  What is the length of each side?

solution: |
  sides_dict = {
    "pentagon": 5,
    "hexagon": 6,
    "octagon": 8
  }
  
  num_sides = sides_dict[shape_name]
  side_length = perimeter // num_sides
  
  Answer = side_length
