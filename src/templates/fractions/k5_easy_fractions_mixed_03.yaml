  Answer:
    type: string

template: |
  Write {{numerator}}/{{denominator}} as a mixed number.

solution: |
  # Simplify first
  common = math.gcd(numerator, denominator)
  num = numerator // common
  den = denominator // common
  
  # Convert to mixed number
  whole_part = num // den
  remainder = num % den
  
  if remainder == 0:
      Answer = str(whole_part)
  else:
      Answer = f"{whole_part} {remainder}/{den}"
