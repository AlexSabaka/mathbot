variables:
  var:
    type: string
    choices: [x, y, n]
  gcf:
    type: integer
    min: 2
    max: 6
  a:
    type: integer

  b:
    type: integer
    min: 2
    max: 8
  Answer:
    type: string

template: |
  Factor out the greatest common factor: {{gcf * a}}{{var}} + {{gcf * b}}

solution: |
  # GCF is gcf
  # Factor: gcf(a*var + b)
  Answer = f"{gcf}({a}{var} + {b})"
