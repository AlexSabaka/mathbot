template: |
  A toy store had {{number1}} toys in stock. They sold {{number2}} toys in the morning and {{number3}} toys in the afternoon.
  How many toys are left in the store?

solution: |
  # Ensure we don't get negative results
  total_sold = number2 + number3

  # If total sold would exceed inventory, adjust
  if total_sold >= number1:
      # Recalculate to ensure positive result
      total_sold = number1 - 100  # Leave at least 100 items

  Answer = number1 - total_sold
