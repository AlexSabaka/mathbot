variables:
  x_coord:
    type: integer
    min: -10
    max: 10
  
  y_coord:
    type: integer
    min: -10

  Answer:
    type: string

template: |
  Plot the point ({{x_coord}}, {{y_coord}}) on a coordinate plane.
  
  In which quadrant is the point located?

solution: |
  # Determine quadrant based on coordinates
  # Ensure both coordinates are non-zero for clear quadrant
  if x_coord == 0 or y_coord == 0:
      if x_coord == 0 and y_coord == 0:
          Answer = "origin"
      elif x_coord == 0:
          Answer = "y-axis"
      else:
          Answer = "x-axis"
  elif x_coord > 0 and y_coord > 0:
      Answer = "Quadrant I"
  elif x_coord < 0 and y_coord > 0:
      Answer = "Quadrant II"
  elif x_coord < 0 and y_coord < 0:
      Answer = "Quadrant III"
  else:  # x_coord > 0 and y_coord < 0
      Answer = "Quadrant IV"
