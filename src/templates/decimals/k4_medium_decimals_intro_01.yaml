  {{name}} has {{dollars}} dollars, {{dimes}} dimes, and {{pennies}} pennies.

  Write the total amount as a decimal.

  # Convert dimes to dollars (1 dime = 0.10)
  dimes_in_dollars = dimes * 0.10

  # Convert pennies to dollars (1 penny = 0.01)
  pennies_in_dollars = pennies * 0.01

  # Calculate total
  total = dollars + dimes_in_dollars + pennies_in_dollars

  Answer = round(total, 2)
