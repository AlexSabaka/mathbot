template: |
  {{name1}} is {{a}} years older than {{name2}}. The sum of their ages is {{sum_ages}}. How old is each person?

solution: |
  # Let x = age of name2
  # Then x + a = age of name1
  # x + (x + a) = sum_ages
  # 2x + a = sum_ages
  # 2x = sum_ages - a
  # x = (sum_ages - a) / 2
  age_name2 = (sum_ages - a) // 2
  age_name1 = age_name2 + a
  
  Answer1 = age_name1
  Answer2 = age_name2
