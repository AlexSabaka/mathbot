  Answer:
    type: string

template: |
  Find all positive divisors of {{n}}.

solution: |
  # Find all factors by checking divisibility
  factors = []
  for i in range(1, n + 1):
    if n % i == 0:
      factors.append(i)
  
  # Format as comma-separated string
  Answer = ", ".join(str(f) for f in factors)
