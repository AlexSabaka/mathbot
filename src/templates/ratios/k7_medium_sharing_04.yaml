template: |
  A team working on {{project_type}} wins a prize of {{total_prize_formatted}}.
  
  {{name1}} worked {{hours1}} hours, {{name2}} worked {{hours2}} hours, and {{name3}} worked {{hours3}} hours.
  
  The team decides to split the prize proportionally based on hours worked.
  
  How much does each person receive?
  
  Please solve this problem and provide your final answer.

solution: |
  total_hours = hours1 + hours2 + hours3
  amount1 = total_prize * (hours1 / total_hours)
  amount2 = total_prize * (hours2 / total_hours)
  amount3 = total_prize * (hours3 / total_hours)
  
  Answer1 = round(amount1, 2)
  Answer2 = round(amount2, 2)
  Answer3 = round(amount3, 2)
