template: |
  {{name}} wants to tile a rectangular floor that is {{length}} {{unit}} long and {{width}} {{unit}} wide.
  Each square tile has sides of {{tile_size}} {{unit}}.
  How many tiles does {{name}} need?

solution: |
  # Step 1: Calculate floor area
  floor_area = length * width

  # Step 2: Calculate tile area
  tile_area = tile_size * tile_size

  # Step 3: Divide floor area by tile area
  Answer = floor_area // tile_area
