template: |
  {{name}} draws a triangle with one angle of {{obtuse_angle}} degrees.
  Can this triangle have another angle greater than 90 degrees? Explain.

solution: |
  # In a triangle, the sum of all angles must equal 180 degrees
  # If one angle is > 90, the other two must sum to < 90
  # Therefore, neither of the other two angles can be > 90
  remaining_sum = 180 - obtuse_angle

  if remaining_sum <= 90:
      Answer = "No, because the other two angles must sum to " + str(remaining_sum) + " degrees, which means each must be less than 90 degrees."
  else:
      # Shouldn't happen with obtuse_angle > 90
      Answer = "No"
