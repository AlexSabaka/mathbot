variables:
  a:
    type: integer
    min: 30
    max: 90
  b:
    type: integer
    min: 30
    max: 90
  Answer:
    type: string

template: |
  List all common divisors of {{a}} and {{b}}.

solution: |
  # Find all factors of a
  factors_a = []
  for i in range(1, a + 1):
    if a % i == 0:
      factors_a.append(i)
  
  # Find all factors of b
  factors_b = []
  for i in range(1, b + 1):
    if b % i == 0:
      factors_b.append(i)
  
  # Find common factors
  common = []
  for f in factors_a:
    if f in factors_b and f not in common:
      common.append(f)
  
  # Sort and format as comma-separated string
  common = sorted(common)
  Answer = ", ".join(str(f) for f in common)
