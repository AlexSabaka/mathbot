template: |
  In a bag of marbles, there are {{a}} red marbles and {{b}} blue marbles. What is the ratio of red marbles to total marbles? Simplify if possible.

solution: |
  import math
  
  total = a + b
  gcd = math.gcd(a, total)
  simplified_a = a // gcd
  simplified_total = total // gcd
  
  Answer = f"{simplified_a}:{simplified_total}"
