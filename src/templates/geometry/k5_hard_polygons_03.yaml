template: |
  {{name}} drew a polygon with {{num_sides}} sides.
  What is the name of this polygon, and how many diagonals can be drawn from one vertex?

solution: |
  names = {
    5: "pentagon",
    6: "hexagon",
    7: "heptagon",
    8: "octagon"
  }
  
  # Diagonals from one vertex = n - 3
  # (Cannot connect to itself or two adjacent vertices)
  diagonals = num_sides - 3
  
  Answer1 = names[num_sides]
  Answer2 = diagonals
