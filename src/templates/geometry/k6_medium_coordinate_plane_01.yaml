  Answer:
    type: string

template: |
  Point A is at ({{x_start}}, {{y_start}}). Point B is {{move_right}} units to the right and {{move_up}} units up from Point A.
  
  What are the coordinates of Point B?

solution: |
  new_x = x_start + move_right
  new_y = y_start + move_up
  Answer = f"({new_x}, {new_y})"
