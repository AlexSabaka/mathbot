  Answer:
    type: integer

template: |
  A research submarine starts at {{depth_start}} feet below sea level. It rises {{rise1}} feet, descends {{descend}} feet, and then rises another {{rise2}} feet. What is its final depth? (Express your answer as a negative number for below sea level.)

solution: |
  # Start below sea level (negative)
  position = -depth_start
  
  # Apply changes in order
  position = position + rise1
  position = position - descend
  position = position + rise2
  
  Answer = position
