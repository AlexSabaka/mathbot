template: |
  A concert venue has {{total_people}} people attending. Each row of seats holds {{seats_per_row}} people. How many rows will be completely filled? How many empty seats will be in the partially filled row?

solution: |
  # Calculate rows needed
  full_rows = total_people // seats_per_row
  people_in_partial = total_people % seats_per_row
  
  # Calculate empty seats
  if people_in_partial > 0:
    empty_seats = seats_per_row - people_in_partial
    Answer = f"{full_rows} rows completely filled | {empty_seats} empty seats"
  else:
    # All rows are full
    Answer = f"{full_rows} rows completely filled | 0 empty seats"
