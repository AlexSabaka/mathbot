template: |
  A submarine is at {{depth_start}} feet below sea level. It rises {{rise}} feet, then descends {{descend}} feet. What is the submarine's final position relative to sea level? (Use negative numbers for below sea level.)

solution: |
  # Start below sea level (negative)
  position = -depth_start
  
  # Rising means adding (going toward surface)
  position = position + rise
  
  # Descending means subtracting (going deeper)
  position = position - descend
  
  Answer = position
