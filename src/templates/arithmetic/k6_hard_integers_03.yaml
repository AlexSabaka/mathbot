    type: integer

template: |
  {{name}} is scuba diving. First, {{name}} dives down {{depth1}} feet below the surface. Then {{name}} swims up {{depth2}} feet, and finally dives down another {{depth3}} feet. What is {{name}}'s final position relative to the water surface? (Use negative numbers for below the surface.)

solution: |
  # Start at surface (0)
  position = 0
  
  # Dive down (subtract)
  position = position - depth1
  
  # Swim up (add)
  position = position + depth2
  
  # Dive down again (subtract)
  position = position - depth3
  
  Answer = position
