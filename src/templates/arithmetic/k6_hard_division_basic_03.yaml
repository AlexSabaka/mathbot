  # Calculate full boxes
  full_boxes = total_cookies // box_size
  cookies_in_partial = total_cookies % box_size
  
  # Format answer
  if cookies_in_partial > 0:
    Answer = f"{full_boxes} boxes completely filled | {cookies_in_partial} cookies in partial box"
  else:
    Answer = f"{full_boxes} boxes completely filled | 0 cookies in partial box"
