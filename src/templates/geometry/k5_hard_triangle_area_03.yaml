template: |
  {{name}} drew a triangle with a base of {{base}} cm, height of {{height}} cm, and the other two sides are {{side_b}} cm and {{side_c}} cm.
  Calculate both the area and the perimeter.

solution: |
  # Area = (base × height) / 2
  area = (base * height) / 2
  
  # Perimeter = sum of all sides
  perimeter = base + side_b + side_c
  
  Answer1 = int(area)
  Answer2 = perimeter
